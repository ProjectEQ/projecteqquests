For each you bring me I shall instruct you on the next step in the process and provide you with one of the required pieces. Completing each step will require acquiring even more items. The process is time-consuming, but the power of a phylactery is such that it will benefit even a bearer who does not aspire to lichdom. When you are certain you are ready to begin, talk to my assistant, Jeyular and hand him. hmmm, where shall we start?
