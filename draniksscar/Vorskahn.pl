The only trouble is these blasted kyvs. Their bows can strike a field mouse under a new moon at a thousand paces. A few of my fighters fall to their arrows with every retreat. If you are truly sympathetic to our cause, you will bring me as many kyv hearts as you can. We need their numbers thinned out now more than ever.");
