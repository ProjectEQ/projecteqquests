#Beginner Combat Manual
#
#As a note, according to posts at Alla's (not the most reliable source I know, 
#but all I've got right now) the Beginner's quests eat the Planar Traveler's Manual, 
#so that quest must be completed 3 times in order to do all the Beginner's Manual 
#Quests.  This is intended behaviour.
# items: 28787, 28745, 28788

I came to New Tanaan to further develop my teaching skills; it seems we all have our own lessons to learn. I can teach you a few things if you are looking to be taught. I will teach you the basics of planar combat if you are [willing to learn].");

Years ago I discovered a particular concoction that will very readily put your willpower to the test. Unfortunately I ran out not too long ago and I am in need of some more [Planar Blood Brew]. If you can make some more for my students, it would certainly look favorably upon you in your future teachings. Bring me some along with your Planar Traveler's Manual.");
