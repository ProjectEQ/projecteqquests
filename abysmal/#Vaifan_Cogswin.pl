Now that you are here, I can stop that and focus on compiling the information I already have. Let me tell you, being in charge of something like this is very taxing on the nerves. I remember being a young gnome and whenever I tinkered something it worked the first time. Ah, how good it felt to put the Cogswin family emblem on my wonderful creations. Nowadays it seems like everything I make has some intermittent flaw or defect. I might have to accept that I am getting old and a little slow, but I still have the wits to invent. I should stop rambling and get to the point. I am in charge of scouting the mountain areas known as [Tipt], [Vxed], and the [sewers] under the city. Which would you like to know about?");

So, being the genius that I am, I came up with a plan to use a prototype clockwork scout I built when we were having problems exploring the catacombs in Mistmoore. He appeared to be working fine. I received constant detailed reports on the sewers and mountain areas until one day it stopped. For some time I tried to make contact with the clockwork, but nothing. I started working on a second one to retrieve the first when Falcin stumbled onto the boat. In his struggle to get back to us he had to make his escape through the sewers. While going through there, he found this. This is the reporting module used by the clockwork scout. It does not look like much now, but you should have seen it when Falcin gave it to me. I have repaired most of the damage in an attempt to access the information stored within, but there are four vital components missing. I need you to go to the four sewer areas and find a timing gear, a rusty spring, an oiled belt, and a processing gizmo. When you have them all, place them inside the gearbox and combine them. Once this has been done, the gearbox should give you a report. Return the report to me.");

Many of these beasts can be found in the mountain area called Vxed. After being severely damaged in Tipt, the clockwork scout made its way back to Vxed to perform self maintenance, but I believe this is where it met its final demise. While the chance is slim, I believe you may be able to salvage enough of the parts from the creatures within Vxed to reassemble the frame. What you will need to find is a flickering finkenheimer, a tarnished sprocket, some uncoiled springs, a greased bolt, and some connection rods. When you have them all place, the sprocket, springs, bolt, and rods in the finkenheimer and bring me the result. I must warn you to be careful though. If these things could stop my clockwork, they must be pretty powerful creatures.");

Tipt in particular is thick with members of the invading army, dangerous creatures, and the angry spirits of nihil refugees. Looking at the information I have, the clockwork scout tried to take a direct path to the other side of Tipt and had some serious problems. Apparently, it had a run in with some cragbeasts, a pack of ghosts, numerous Muramites, and a native riddlemaster. While he made it pretty far, he took significant damage each step of the way. My last report received for this area stated that it was returning to the Vxed area to recover, but had lost multiple power cells in the process. I need you to retrieve these power cells. They are vital to rebuilding the scout and getting that report. There are five different types of cells, each one is called Vaifan's Power Cell -- named after the most ingenious gnome there is, of course. The cells are named from A to E. When you have collected all of them, place them in this power pack, activate it, and return it to me.");
