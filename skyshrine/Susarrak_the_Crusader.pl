I sense that the loyalty you bear toward the children of scale is strong but the siren voice that has called you to us is still a whisper upon your mind, and it is a song of curiosity and greed that fuels you yet. Since the dawn of your creation, all of your kind has proven that without tangible reward to do otherwise, your blades would be aimed for our hearts. But do not think we fault you for merely this -- such shallow lusts have become a definition of your kind, and we do not bear you ill will for it. However, the [champions] are not as the others of Veeshan's brood and your past deeds shall [not bear fruitful] in your dealings with us.");

Fate has given room for nothing short of this declaration and the recent past has demanded our attention and duty to be thus. Your kind, the second generation, has dangerously shifted the destiny of all upon this world and it is your ignorant and lustful actions that have forced us into existence as we are now. Kerafyrm, the Sleeper, was well guarded for all these years not without dire justification -- he could not be destroyed by means conceivable by dragon or second generation alike, and now you have unleashed him and a much darker shadow lurks with venomous tendrils over all of this world's inhabitants. We are those whose existence is to combat this shadow and [keep it at bay], despite all costs and with all sacrifice.");

The elders of the council knew that this would not be enough. Before the great war that would yield Kerafyrm's incarceration, the warders were instructed to mate with four dragons of elements as their own individually. The offspring of these unions would be trained for the undivided purpose of fulfilling their predecessors' duties when their fate would inevitably dawn.

For months the deliberations and cordial arguments raged, but all that would eventually come would be the unspoken disapproval of the council and the apprentices' self-imposed adoption of a new and more necessary duty. The Crusaders of Veeshan were born upon the very steps of the council's sacred hall and in respectful defiance, we have come to Skyshrine to fulfill our purpose.

But do not take these words lightly, nor think yourself a hero standing in the fading shadow of a great monster. Although those of you whom still bear allegiance to the Claws of Veeshan will be asked by the Crusaders to engage these monstrosities of Veeshan's brood, you shall gain neither repute nor true victory if you succeed in such a task -- you may gain some favor in our eyes and perhaps an eye to separate you from those of your kind that have betrayed all of this world.");

During this time, Kerafyrm had established allies within the Velious nation -- amongst these allies were four elders upon the very council that sought to destroy him. Kildrukaun, the former Arch Priest of Veeshan and driving force behind the original decree that forbade the existence of creatures such as Kerafyrm was the first to betray the Claws of Veeshan.

The ancients are powerful immortals indeed, but their forms lie on the primal world and thus they are subject to its laws, however vain they ultimately prove to be.

However, be warned that the Ancient's forms are unpredictable and we are not certain what will remain intact once their essence and consciousness have fled their forms and you may find yourself standing before the lifeless form of a monstrous behemoth, but the scales you seek may be too damaged or deteriorated from the sudden loss of its life-giving essence.");

If and when you have successfully extracted the heart of each Ancient, you shall return them to me. Mind you, this feat is not one that will be as simple as charging and defeating each of the Ancients, for their forms are unpredictable and the ways in which they are bound to this earth are those of a delicate balance between chaos, consciousness, and power.
