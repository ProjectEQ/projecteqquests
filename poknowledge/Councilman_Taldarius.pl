If you cannot find what you are looking for here in the Myrist library, I most certainly can add it to my list of things to look for in the Planes. Unfortunately, I am quite busy at the moment, planning my next trip to the Elemental Planes. I believe my aid may have some tasks he could use help with. That is, if you are skilled enough.'");
