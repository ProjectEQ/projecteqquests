I hate to do this, but before I can convince my foreman to give you a reward, I am going to need to ask you to help me again. According to another adventurer that passed through here the other day, there is a golem graveyard of sorts in a temple somewhere on this continent. If you could find this place and gather one clay golem part that would help us greatly with repairs. Why do we need these golem parts you ask? I have no idea. Grumpy, our foreman said we needed them for some sort of repairs. Oh yeah, take this badge. It identifies you as part of the ship's maintenance crew. Just hand the badge to me when you hand in the golem parts.");

That doesnt sound good at all. We will need your help to get some sort of anti rust agent. What? Hey, dont get mad at me. I am sorry I keep asking for help, but I am just following Grumby's orders. There is a gnomish tinker in Ak'anon named Gilipus that might have something to help us. Go there and hand him this note along with your badge so he knows you are working for Grumby. I promise to reward you for your time when you are done helping us. Take your badge back and give it to me again when you hand in the anti-rusting agent.");
