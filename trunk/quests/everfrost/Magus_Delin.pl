Or perhaps I'm simply an eccentric who hopes there is a greater force out there that is granting us the use of new magics. Anyway, enough chatter. Tell me where you would like to go and I will send you there. I can send you to any of the other camps in [Butcherblock], [Commonlands], [Nedaria's Landing], [North Ro], or [South Ro].
