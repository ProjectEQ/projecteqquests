So with this knowledge it is that we hope and believe somehow Gandak is still alive and is either making his way to the Karanas or is just somewhere that we cannot find him yet. We have heard of a group of Pirates originating from a [fortress in the sea] that might be responsible.");

They are claiming responsibility for many of these sea hijackings and I believe that if Gandak is alive he might be there. If you wish to travel to attempt to gain knowledge about his disappearance seek out the mystical boat that docks in the Stonebrunt Mountains. If you should find Gandak please give him this medallion that he will know has come from us.");
