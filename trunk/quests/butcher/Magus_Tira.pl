I can send you to any of the other camps in [Everfrost], [Commonlands], [Nedaria's Landing], [North Ro], or [South Ro]. Hopefully I won't burn my hands this time! Long story, but my cohort, Gaelan Charhands, didn't tell me one of the words of the spell as a joke. Apparently it's funny for a beautiful gnome like myself to get her hands singed. I'll get him back some day!");
