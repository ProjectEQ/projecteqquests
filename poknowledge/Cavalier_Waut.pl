Many of us 'ave delved into the past lives of our ventures upon Norrath an' 'ave brought forth from the recesses of our memories the spells that we once wielded as might t'our cause. Now, we no longer be needin' them, but we understand that ye may very well find them t'be of use yet. Oh, and if ye find an item of arcane nature though it seems t'be mundane or useless t'ye, dinnae disregard it! The planes 'old many items that are not what they seem, friend. Return such incorporeal runes and scrolls t'me and I shall make them spells worhty of any crusading paladin!");
