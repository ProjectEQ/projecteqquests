I believe that I was the last to see him alive. His behavior at the time seemed peculiar, but I shrugged it off as simply a man blissfully in love,");

He was very excited, said he thought it would be the perfect gift for Kalila on their wedding night, so you see why I never mentioned it. Anyway, he said that he had just gathered all of the ingredients and was heading back out of Katta.");
