My exploring brought me here, and I saw some wonderous things. I ventured inside this ancient tomb with some friends, and oh! The horrors we encountered! I barely made it out alive, but I did manage to pick up some [weapons to trade].");

Anyhow, I was unlucky in finding those, but I did manage to get a couple weapons... Sadly, they're really more suited to a [Monk] or a [Knight], not really much use to a warrior like myself at all.");

I guess I would trade them to ya if you were to give me a warhammer for em. I gotta say, I'm not picky. I'd accept either a primal or a priceless warhammer, and give you these wraps in a straight trade. Heck, I'd take one of each and give you both these hand wraps.");

Well, look here, I got two swords from inside the tomb, but I'll be damned if either of em was suited for a warrior. Clearly a knight's blade, what bad luck for me. I was hopin for a good warsword. That's why I'm standin out here ya know? I was hopin I could find someone who might swap me either a primal or priceless warsword, and take one of these knightly swords in trade.");
