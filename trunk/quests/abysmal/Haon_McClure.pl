I was the only survivor, tossed ashore on a deserted island.  It was easy enough to survive with my skills.  That is, until the day that I saw what appeared to be a giant tortoise coming toward the shore.  As it came closer it started to rise out of the water.  Soon it was obvious that it was not a tortoise at all, but the head of a cyclops!  The island was small and I had no place to hide.");

It raised its massive fist to crush me and, I supposed, eat what was left.  Out of frustration I simply yelled, 'STOP!'  And it did!  It stopped and stood there, looking down at me.  I learned from him later that nobody had ever talked to him before.  He said that people generally just attacked him or ran off screaming.  The only thing he could do in either case was to crush them and eat what was left.  We became fast friends, and he carried me from the island another, inhabited, island.  Unfortunately his arrival caused the locals to run around screaming and to try to attack him . . .");

I just stuck my hand in the water and wiggled my pointin' finger just like it was a worm.  Sure enough, that tuna practically swallowed my whole hand.
