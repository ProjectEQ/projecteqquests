After a long day's work I took a seat at the end of the bar in a local pub. Trying to get my mind off of potions for a while, I overheard a story about a crazy man roaming Tenebrous Mountains. Everyone seemed to know him as Hoober the Delirious. Seems he had become something of a local legend for his very odd habit of asking people to gather some rather obscure ingredients in exchange for a very rare reward.");

People laughed him off as a lunatic and after finally meeting Hoober I could easily tell why, but his story piqued my interest given my current... project. I asked the fellows to repeat the ingredients this man requested, but they were drinking rather heavily and had paid little attention in the first place. They were very vague, but what they could remember sounded very similar to a partial recipe I had found a record of earlier that very day. Against my better judgement I sought out this wanderer and we had a most interesting conversation.");

He knew what he was talking about, it seemed like this had to be it, the answer to what I was seeking. So I gathered up the components and combined them myself, and then it all went so horribly wrong...' It takes him a moment to regain his train of thought, 'You wouldn't even be able to have an intelligible conversation with this man due to the cripling nature of the addiction unless someone made you up a batch.");

Kanaad seems to wrack his brain for alternatives, silent for a long moment. His inner conflict evident, he steadies himself for what he is about to do, 'I suppose that I am the only one who can mix this potion for you properly. I can... yes, I have no doubt that I will be fine.' His inner demons put somewhat out of his mind, Kanaad looks you straight in the eyes and says, 'I will need a Luclin clover, a drop of moonlight and some essence of sonnet.");

No amount of effort or studying will help them either- it is an unexpected thing. You see, bards dedicate their life to the telling and retelling of stories, it is their job to inspire others with tales of triumph and tragedy. When a bard of the highest order sees or hears something that so genuinely and so overwhelmingly inspires them, something magical happens");
