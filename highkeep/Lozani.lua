I have been sent forth from the great Library of Mechanimagica in the city of Ak'Anon. to study the arcane knowledge of man and beast alike.  I have studied many languages and spells. from Crushbone to Kerra Ridge.  I have found most languages hard to decipher.  As of this date. I have learned to read only the script of the [orc oracles].  Oh well. I am on a five decade mission.  Better luck next language.");

It was as if rats had gone and died in their mouths. I wished I could read minds after those days. TWENTY WEEKS of that rat-carcass breath and all I have learned is the ability to decipher [oracle scrolls] and [apprentice cantrips]. What a mess that was! I'm beginning to think I should have become a Gemchopper.");

I fill in the blanks with a second orc cantrip and my universe of knowledge, so you never know what spell is going to be scribed! Could be magic, could be wizardry, could be necromancy, golly!! Sometimes I even end up with a recipe!! If you want me to try to decipher one just hand me two illegible cantrips. No coinage necessary!! They are mostly apprentice spells. Nothing much.");
