-- Quests for Bard Lambent Armor
-- For the bard epic, saying note is suppose to give you a page
-- Sadly I couldn't figure out how this worked (I think it was triggered by what crystals I had)
-- Luckily this part is just lore, and we can get the flag w/o doing that stuff
-- So for now, saying note does nothing :(
-- items: 2318, 10119, 10561, 2319, 10117, 4114, 4115, 10128, 4116
