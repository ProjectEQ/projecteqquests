Our shady background wasn't a problem in the past, but now he refuses to speak with us. We suspect he has turned over a new leaf and now that he considers himself a champion of the people, he doesn't want to tarnish this reputation. If you can convince those that have spoken out against Stanos to [" .. eq.say_link("change their tune") .. "], I think we stand a chance of garnering the favor of this contact again.

It's a 'request' that they speak favorably about our generous benefactor, lest some ill fate befall them. If they refuse, you know what to do. Empty threats mean nothing.");
