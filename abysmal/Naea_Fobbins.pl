When we heard that they were sailing for lands unknown we just had to go. Truth be told, I do miss home though. I had quite a lucrative business in Rivervale making [necklaces].");

They were quite wonderful and I was able to make a nice necklace from them. If you could bring me some shells from Natimbi, I can try to make you one as well. I have nothing else to do at the moment. Are you [interested]?");
