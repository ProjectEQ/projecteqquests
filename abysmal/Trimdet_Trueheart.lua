Bring me a Muramite Helm Armor piece and I can shape it to suit you, then you must take some Muramite metal that has been infused with Nalasrine's mixture and put it together in a forge to form a new helm.");

Don't forget to infuse the metal with the misxture from Nalasrine before you take it to the forge.");

I am sure Nalasrine can assist you with infusing the metal, which needs to be done before you forge it. Bring me the Muramite Glove Armor and I will shape some gauntlets for you. Then all you need to do is the final touch with the infused metal and the gauntlets in a forge.");
