You will gather various items from all areas of Freeport from monsters and stores alike. You will use specific item combinations in this kit to fashion together armor materials that you will combine in a forge with the appropriate mold to make an armor piece. Once you are ready to attempt a piece of armor simply tell me what piece you want to craft. I will then present you with the recipe and mold for Steel Warrior [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].");

Suffering a blow to the hands that would prevent you from defending yourself would most certainly mean death. To create your gauntlet material you will need to combine three Bricks of Crude Iron Ore, one Armadillo Tail, one Severed Orc Foot, and two Spider Legs in your assembly kit.

I don't have all the pieces I need to make one. If you could retrieve a Pristine Giant Scarab Leg, one Lion Paw and one Vial of Smoke I will have all I need to create this weapon.
