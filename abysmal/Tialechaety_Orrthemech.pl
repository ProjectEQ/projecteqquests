Then bring it to me and I'll put you to work. Work hard enough and I'll teach you the secret for treating dark matter. Of course, since I am asking you to provide some of the material for the work, I will reward you more quickly than Skelontorim. So gather up some dark matter and hand it to me, and I'll give you some chores to do.");

I have figured out a way to use dark matter as a power supply for gauze presses. It's still a bit tricky to use and keep working, but they tend to last longer if handled properly. All I need you to do is put the dark matter into the presses. That sounds easy, but because dark matter is so unstable, it is difficult to place properly into the device without breaking or contaminating it. I'm certain that you can do it, though. When you have the presses ready, bring them back to me.");

I think I have discovered a new way to make flares that are not only more visible, but more distinctive. They should be more useful that simple fireworks for sending signals. The difficulty is that these flares use dark matter. I'm a little worried that a mistake might cause some damage to the tinkerer doing the work. But I can see that such danger does not discourage you! Here are some flares and some dark matter. Make sure to only use one scrap of dark matter in each flare!
