 me?  If you've come to help please show me your acrylia slate.");

the Grimling fishing huts if I had to guess. She'll fill the bottle with water for you. Take this
water and combine it with the Acrylia sand purifer. That will yield the purest water you ever did
drink.");

Hollow palm roots. You can find Hollow palms out in the moors, watch out for the grimlings though.
Once you find the roots just use the strainer to control the flow of water over the leaves. If
you do it correctly you'll create a very potent brew. When you get it right bring the strainer back
to me with a sample of your work.");

brewing. You'll need a steady hand if you are to master the brew barrel. The first thing you'll
need to learn is how to purify the water we use for all our finest brews. Take this Acrylia filter
and use it to [purify water]. Bring me 4 flasks of crystal clear water and I'll teach you how to make
the tea from the gravel tea leaves.");

 though, you might want to try adding some spices next time for a bit more flavor. Here's your
 strainer back, I etched some runes into that should add to the potency of your brews. I hear the
 grimlings make a very potent sort of tea from the grimroot out in the forest, but the thought of
 drinking anything made from grimroot makes my stomach churn. At any rate, tinker a bit with that
 strainer and don't be afraid of trying some new brews with it. If you create anything interesting
 that you think I might like bring it to me so I can taste it.");
