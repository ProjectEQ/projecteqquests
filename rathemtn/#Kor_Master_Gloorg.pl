Unfortunately I have been unable to keep up to date on your progress, but should you need advanced training in any individual skills, I am here to help you with that. As well, I am here to guide you through your growth as a Cleric in the Guktan Army. With the skills that you learn here, you will be better prepared to serve the Army. If you do indeed plan on following the path of a [Cleric], I have some tasks that you will need to complete, if it suits your interest.");

This will create a material that you will use to craft a suit of armor that will protect you from the various dangers of Norrath, for years to come. If you are ready to begin your task, I will give you the assembly kit, as well as instructions for collecting the necessary items to craft your armor.

When you are ready to receive a recipe for a specific material, simply tell me which armor piece you [wish to craft]. I hold the recipe's for Kor Initiates [Helms], [Bracers], [Boots], [Armguards], [Legplates], [Gloves] and [Breastplates]. Keep in mind that the items required to make some of the larger pieces of armor will be a bit more difficult to get.
