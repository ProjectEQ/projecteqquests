Many of the reports gave details on various things like wildlife and climate as well as the local inhabitants and level of advancement.

Falcin left here under the light of a full moon and returned soon after barely able to breathe. He had been caught spying on the beings that currently control the continent. They had tortured him for hours trying to get information. Being the resourceful human he is, he managed to escape only to be mauled by what the natives call ukun, a humanoid creature that is twisted and lethal.

Those who he could not find he assumed were dead but he still tried to get some proof before he wrote them off. Unfortunately Falcin would not live to see his desire through, he passed on shortly after revealing this information to us and now we are at a loss as to how we can help our scouts who are still living return to us and provide a proper burial for those who were lost.

Each socket requires a gem fragment of a certain resonance. As the fragments are set in the stone it will gradually increase in power. These fragments must be placed in the stone in a certain order using a set of clockwork gemcutter's tools, the stone, and the correct shard in the device I handed to you along with the stone. As you help find our scouts, you may come across the gem fragments that will fit into the stone. If you do, please try combining them in the special sealer.
