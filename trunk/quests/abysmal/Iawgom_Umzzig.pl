I was in Lake Rathe on vacation, just tryin' to relax.  I had been having a reasonable day and had caught more than I needed for lunch and dinner.  I was making my last cast for the day.  I pulled the line back and tossed it far.  Just before it hit the water, a huge dark form swept down and grabbed it!  It was a bird!  The thing must have been twenty feet from wingtip to wingtip.  I stood and watched, absently clutching my pole.  Suddenly I'm yanked up into the air!  In a few seconds I was so far from the ground that the lake was the size of a mug of ale!  It was a lucky thing that I was usin' my special heavy-duty line that day.  I had to get down and there was only one way to do it.  I started lettin' out my line.  It took all my strength, but I finally got low enough to drop into the lake.  It was a long swim back, but I survived.");
