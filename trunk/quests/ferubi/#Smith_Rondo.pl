As a result, my aura has changed, making this farstone useless. I do not know what it is I am becoming, but I will not place the lives of the brotherhood in danger. I have decided to give in to the inevitable and serve these beings. Please tell Taminoa I am sorry, but this is for the best. And please give him this. As I slip deeper and deeper into insanity, I have lost my ability to articulate my thoughts on paper. This is one of my last written reports and I think Taminoa will find it quite interesting.");
