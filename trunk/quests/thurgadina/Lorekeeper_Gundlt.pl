When you first see the boots of our Lord you must kneel before him and touch your forehead to your knee. At this point you may rise and address the king. He will not respond to the popular and mundane \"Hail.\" You must say, 'Greetings and good fortune to you, honored Dain Frostreaver IV.' Remember to mind your manners when in the presence of the Dain for his guards are fiercely protective of him.");
