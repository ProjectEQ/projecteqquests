Though our guidance is that of spells native to your world, the mystic scribes in this city may hold some convenience for we do not hold the prejudice of the material world's citizens. Beyond these familiar scrolls, I may be able to aid you further should you bring me a fledgling arcane item from the planes. You will know of that which I speak if and when you stumble upon such a rare and seemingly mundane item. Do not be fooled by its plain appearance - the primordial essence of pure magic resides in these arcane relics and I can be the key to unlock them to the shamanistic powers.");
