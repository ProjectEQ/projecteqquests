   quest::say("Ohhh, I love fish stew and it's fairly simple to make. If you're looking to make a
 large pot of it, you'll want to be sure that you have enough ingredients ready from the start.
 Gather up a flask of water, a jug of sauce, some spices and two wetfang steaks. Cook them in an
 oven in a large stewing pot. For being so foul, those wetfangs sure taste good. Throw all of that
 in to simmer for a bit and you're ready to go.");
