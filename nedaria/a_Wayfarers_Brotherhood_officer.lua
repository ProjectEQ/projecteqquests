'I sense it now, the one that put Siflu under the control of that Muramite is the same one that destroyed my body. It is too powerful for me to defeat if we encounter it directly. You will need to create a device that can harness and control the power of the elements. This will be difficult because I do not know exactly what you need. I can describe their function. You will need a container. It must be open to the elements but still hold the items you will put inside. You will be able to use that loadstone to focus the power on the right target, since it was made by the one we seek. Those horrible manacles will also serve to contain the energy and focus it. Then you will need a powerful segment of each element. You can use Earthcaller and Swiftwind to represent the spirit of Earth and Air, but you will need such a thing for Fire and Water as well. Without this item I will not be able to free any spirit directly under his control.");
