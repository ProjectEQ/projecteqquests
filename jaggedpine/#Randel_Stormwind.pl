us have been kind of edgy lately. We've lived here for generations and in relative seclusion
and we enjoyed a simple life for the most part. Unfortunately, this was not to last and the
sudden [change] has left many on edge.");

    quest::say("There are a lot of people that resent the outsiders and view their presence as
corrupting our way of life. It's more then just the new guards and the sudden influx of people
though. This is sort of a long story that begins when my grandfather was just a lad. It was
during the rule of Antonius III that public [access] to the Jaggedpine Forest [was
restricted].");

through Jaggedpine Forest and into the Unkempt Wood. Most that did were never heard from ever
again. The residents of Surefall feared retaliation from the Unkempt for those trespassing into
their territory and Antonius smartly reasoned that if Surefall Glade were to be taken, Qeynos
would surely be next. So he declared Jaggedpine Forest and all points eastward off limits. So
it was just our ancestors that dwelled on the [Throne of Karana's Fury].");

part in a minute. We who acted as stewards were allowed to come and go as we pleased through
Surefall Glade. For the longest time things were peaceful. Sure, we had problems with the odd
[poacher] here or there but for the most part it was peaceful. However, trouble began when an
[outsider] snuck through Surefall Glade and entered the Unkempt Wood."); #'outsider' still needed

skins. Often they'll kill a mother bear and leave their cubs for dead. If I am able, I'll take
the cub and raise it. If I do my job well, I'm able to release the bear back into the wild once
it is old enough to fend for itself. There is one [group] of poachers I'm particularly worried
about though.");

sadly, I lack skill with a weapon. You on the other hand, look like you can handle yourself

be justly compensated for your efforts.");

I would never have had the skill nor the heart to carry out these miscreant's punishment the
