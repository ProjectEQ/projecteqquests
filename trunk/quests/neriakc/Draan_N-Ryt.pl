It is also used by ogres in the crafting of their war plate and weapons. Adamantite ore can be worked like standard ores into bricks, blocks, and sheets but must be tempered with Neriak Nectar instead of water. Folded sheets of adamantite must also be tempered with Neriak Nectar and must be hammered with our Teir'Dal smithy hammer instead of the crude standard one. Our Teir'Dal enchanters have also developed the means to enchant small bricks of adamantite. Ogres may work adamantite ore in their forge as well but they must temper it with Ogre Swill instead of Neriak Nectar and because of their immense strength still use the standard smithy hammer.");

It is a durable armor that is so light, it does not hinder even those who practice the mystical arts. All pieces of adamantite chainmail require the appropriate chain pattern for the piece desired, a Teir'Dal smithy hammer, a silk swatch, and shadow temper. Veils, neckguards, and bracelets require one set of adamantite rings. Coifs, mantles, skirts, sleeves, and gloves require two sets of adamantite rings. Tunics, capes, and leggings require three sets of adamantite rings. Once you have mastered the art of crafting adamantite chain you may want to attempt [enchanted adamantite] chainmail.");
