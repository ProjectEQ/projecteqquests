With a flick of her wrist, she flings her dagger at the table and it sinks deep into the wood with a satisfying thwack. Just as quickly, she withdraws another pair of previously concealed blades from her bodice and brandishes them menacingly.

She releases her grip on her dagger so that you can get a view of the handle. 'Take a close look. You see the grooves in the handle, the soft leather? This beauty was made specially to fit my hands.
