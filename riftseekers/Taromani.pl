His lands were governed with an iron fist and later abandoned when they no longer served his purpose. This overlord was universally feared and despised. Yet, while his presence was eternally felt, the despot was rarely seen. He had sealed himself away in his citadel in the sky, flanked by his most trusted underlings.
