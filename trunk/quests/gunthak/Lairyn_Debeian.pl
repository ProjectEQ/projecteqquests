They are able to conjure it up in the form of an immense spear of ice. I have seen them do so with my own eyes, though I was watching from afar, of course. I would not dare venture close enough to anger the foul beasts. Their grasp of this magic is simply breathtaking, and from my observations alone, I am very close to unlocking their methods. Unfortunately, I have run into an obstacle, as I cannot complete my research without something more tangible. If only I were brave enough to get closer, or foolish enough. As you can see, I am more intellectual than adventurer.");

The Luggalds often utilize their spells against creatures in the waters of the harbor. Whether this is for practice, or for sport, or to ward off attackers I am not sure. I would suggest investigating the harbor for further evidence. Take this bag and bring me whatever you can find.'");
