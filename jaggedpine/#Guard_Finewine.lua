And if [Bossamir] is right, we're soon to be cut down by ravaging gnolls. Why-oh-why did I get assigned to this job? Why wasn't I assigned to Qeynos where a man can get a decent meal and sleep in a nice bed at night? Oh I'm sorry. Did I say that out loud?");

But that would be par for the course anyway with the way my pitiful life is going. Woe is me. The people in this backward settlement hate me, Sergeant Caelin hates me and I assume Kane hates me too because he sent me to the armpit of Antonica on a suicide mission.");

Rather than that peasant Brandy, use this in your recipe instead. And rather than whatever other 'meat' you were using before use a Panther Liver. You do seem to have some skill as a chef, mayhaps you could work for me some day. Prepare some Panther Pate for me. Give me the Panther Pate and let me read that warning again.");
