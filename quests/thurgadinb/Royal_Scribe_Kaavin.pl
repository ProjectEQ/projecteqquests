I scribe the thoughts of the Dain for posterity. I currently have record books with a combined 11,982 pages of notes detailing the life and business of our present Dain. You see, I have a rather bad memory, so I write everything down. My latest entry is that on this day $name came and talked to me. Anyhow, I'm sure you have much better things to do than talk to me, so good luck in your ventures, $name, and come visit me any time."); }
