New Tanaan is unique from the cities of the prime in that in no other common ground of trade will you find such a diversity and acceptance of culture. Well then. if you are indeed a blacksmith and are seeking materials. please feel free to peruse my inventory at your leisure. I'm sure that I can provide something of use to you. and if not. my brethren will likely carry that which you seek.'"); }
