We believe that he was slain during the day and that deduction coupled with the fact the undead of Kithicor do not leave the woods nor possess the intelligence or means to sneak into Rivervale and leave the tunic where it would surely be found by fellow Storm Reapers led us to believe they were not responsible. We believe it was the work of the Teir'Dal. Search the Kithicor Woods by daylight and punish the Teir'Dal responsible. Return with the villains severed hands as proof of his death.");
