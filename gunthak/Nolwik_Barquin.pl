The troll looked to be dressed a bit differently then most of the other trolls I'd found recently. He had a patch over one eye, and his armor appeared to be of much higher quality then anything the Bashers normally carried. I paid it no heed though, and continued planning my [attack] on the unsuspecting troll.");

It was a larger then normal troll holding a rather large curved sword and shield. It scowled at me with a sort of enraged hunger as it licked its lips in apparent anticipation of a fresh [meal].");
