Yet before I completely lost the ability to see into his realm, I glimpsed a giant stream of mystical fire coming from his tower and shooting upwards into the sky. Once the clouds had parted, another more sinister torrent of magic returned from the sky back to his tower. I believe that Solusek may have an accomplice for whatever he has planned. Though I much prefer subtlety, I fear the time for that has passed.
