I can sense as clear as the warmth of Ro's touch upon our scales that honor washes through the fabric of your being -- honor that has been displayed and proven countless times over in your loyalty to the Claws of Veeshan. But something obstructs purity in you -- your motives are clearer still. All of your kind that have come before us believe we to be as our brethren -- at ease with our stations and at a loss of judgment toward those whom have proven worthy of our recognition and knowledge. Know that the Crusaders do not regard you or your kind to be paralleled in existence unto us -- a regard that the recent, ignorant and disregarding [actions] of your kind has justly and firmly instated within us.");

For centuries the Claws of Veeshan have maintained the prismatic threat's imprisonment, an act that was not achieved without much sacrifice and loss, but now all seems to have been destroyed and left as a struggle that ended in vain. The Sleeper is free and his power grows with every passing moment -- a threat that has descended upon the steel of second generation warriors. You have condemned yourself, as you have since the dawn of your creation, but your actions guided by shallow lusts for power and fame within your fledgling insignificance has spilled into the ancient world that cradles your very existence. It is you who have ushered us into being as we are now -- the apprentices we are no longer and as the [Crusaders of Veeshan] we stand before and shall either [command or disregard you].");

From these unions would be born the apprentices, dragons whom would be dedicated from birth to the maintenance and imprisonment of the darkest threat to descend upon this entire plane of being. Inevitably, the council did not foresee the release of Kerafyrm by the actions of the second generation -- for it was their foolhardy nature to underestimate and ignore the true depths of your fallible existence. When the Sleeper took flight, the apprentices became the Crusaders out of necessity for the unforeseen present. Where our predecessors were of the passive duty to maintain Kerafyrm's imprisoned slumber, the Crusaders must be of aggressive natures to pursue and eliminate his threat once more. But what has been [unleashed] is far more than a prismatic dragon.");

What the council did not know was that four amongst them had vowed their lives to Kerafyrm and would betray all of Veeshan's brood in the first envenomed strike of a civil war. Kerafyrm was eventually apprehended and the warders were successful in the execution of their spell, subduing the great beast that neither claw nor fang could slay. The four elders that had zealously pledged their allegiance to the abomination escaped our grasp and in the years that Kerafyrm slumbered, they remained an impression upon a legend that would never fade. With the council's attentions intent upon maintaining Kerafyrm in their custody and the conflict with Kael rising to the brink of a fiery war, the treacherous elders were not pursued, an inevitable decision that would have [dire consequences] of unfathomable magnitude.");

Their troops, consisting of younger and more impressionable dragons and several hordes of dragon kin, were significantly out numbered by the forces of the Claws of Veeshan, but yet they posed a near infallible opposition. Kerafyrm is indeed a power unto himself and the elders at his side were not forces to be underestimated by even our own council, but something was terribly unbalanced and unnatural within them. Never did Kerafyrm fight at the side of his elder allies and never were they seen in conjunction together. It is this truth that leads us to believe that Kerafyrm's mind, consciousness, and the essence of his power had been infused into those of the elders, for every army and every wave of their attacks were flawlessly choreographed as if the great prismatic dragon conducted each of their movements with his own.");

Tjudawos, the golden arch mage, whose knowledge of the mind are yet to be rivaled, was the first to fall beneath Kildrukaun's spell. Second was Zeixshi-Kar, the silver general who guided the Claws through the then fledgling campaign against the giants of Kael -- a fanatic loyalist to Kildrukaun since before Kerafyrm's birth, it was not surprising to see her allegiance shift, although the impact of her loss was nonetheless irreparable.

The impact of her loss lied within the nature of her being, for the storm dragons will not exist in simultaneous population. It is unknown as to why this phenomenon exists unto this species alone, but it has caused her to become a relic unto herself. When Kerafyrm was apprehended and the elders were lost without trace, the council held a silent remorse in the thought of losing Vyskudra and her kind forever. The elders took flight from Velious when Kerafyrm was apprehended; an act that was executed beneath the direct order of Kerafyrm himself, for their devotion to him is stronger than even our most devout priest's reverence for Veeshan herself.

Kildrukaun has always held a deep-seated hatred for the second generation and his three compeers are not without this same contempt. The nature of their agenda is unknown to us, and shall likely remain an impenetrable mystery until they are prepared to execute their plans, which undoubtedly shall revolve around their leader and his active return.
