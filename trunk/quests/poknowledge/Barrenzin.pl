It all makes sense now, the seemingly random attacks...some objects being taken while others left untouched. I am a fool for I should have seen this earlier!

Nevertheless they have struck and now I must find out who is behind this and what exactly they are trying to accomplish. This note with the seal for my house will garner you a significant reward from your guildmaster.");
