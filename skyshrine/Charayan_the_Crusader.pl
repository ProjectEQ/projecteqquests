I sense that the loyalty you bear toward the children of scale is strong but the siren voice that has called you to us is still a whisper upon your mind, and it is a song of curiosity and greed that fuels you yet. Since the dawn of your creation, all of your kind has proven that without tangible reward to do otherwise, your blades would be aimed for our hearts. But do not think we fault you for merely this -- such shallow lusts have become a definition of your kind, and we do not bear you ill will for it. However, the [champions] are not as the others of Veeshan's brood and your past deeds shall [not bear fruitful] in your dealings with us.");

Fate has given room for nothing short of this declaration and the recent past has demanded our attention and duty to be thus. Your kind, the second generation, has carelessly shifted the destiny of all upon this world and it is your ignorant and lustful actions that have forced us into existence as we are now. Kerafyrm, the Sleeper, was well guarded for all these years not without dire justification -- he cannot be destroyed by means conceivable by dragon or second generation alike. We are those whose existence is to combat this shadow and [keep it at bay], despite all costs and with all sacrifice.");

The elders of the council knew that time's grace upon us was thin and that the warders must be recognized as a temporary means of subduing this threat. Before the great war that would yield Kerafyrm's incarceration, the warders were instructed to mate with four dragons of pure elements as their. The offspring of these unions would be trained for the undivided purpose of fulfilling their predecessors' duties when their fate would inevitably dawn. However, your kind have forced the apprentices into a [new role], one that we had not anticipated, but such was our mistake to overestimate and consider your kind the ability to rise above your debased natures and shallow existence.");

For months the deliberations and cordial arguments raged, but all that would eventually come would be the unspoken disapproval of the council and the apprentices' self-imposed adoption of a new and more necessary duty. We have come to Skyshrine to fulfill our purpose, but those passing months ushered in an unseen darkness that the Crusaders had feared from the first movement of Kerafyrm's eye -- the [ancients] returned.");

You ask for their [names, for their past and for their meaning] to this perilous path that you have set us upon, and your actions have earned you nothing less than the obligation to know the fullest extent of what you have unleashed upon this world. But do not take these words lightly, nor think yourself a hero standing in the fading shadow of a great monster.

During this time, Kerafyrm had established allies within the Velious nation -- amongst these allies were four elders upon the very council that sought to destroy him. Kildrukaun, the former Arch Priest of Veeshan and driving force behind the decree that forbade the existence of creatures such as Kerafyrm was the first to betray the Claws of Veeshan. Vyskudra, the magnificent dragon of the storms followed the lead of her patron and master. Third was Tjudawos, the scholar of the council. Lastly was Zeixshi-Kar, the general who engaged within the fledgling war with the giants of Kael that would last for centuries beyond her departure. These four elders would become the driving force behind Kerafyrm's army and are now the [greatest danger] we face in the current era of this turmoil.");

These creatures are beyond anything you have faced in your lifetime -- beyond the pitiable creatures of your lesser deities' planes and beyond anything that the horde of your entire existence could comprehend. These ancients, these immortal creatures of pure destruction, chaos, and envenomed hate are the key to Kerafyrm's fullest potential.

An entire army of Veeshan's most powerful brood was unable to destroy these creatures, so do not think that you of the second generation could stride beyond that which we could not. But do not be discouraged, for the second generation is not so easily with excuse to walk away from this threat, for as the children of scale are in danger, your kind will suffer a thousand fold if Kerafyrm and his ancient minions are successful. The ancients are powerful immortals indeed, but their forms lie on the primal world and thus they are subject to its laws, however vain they ultimately prove to be. If you are able to engage the Ancients and survive, temporarily extinguishing their corporeal form, you would have completed a great feat that would [hold no permanent impact] on our struggle.");

Undoubtedly, you and your kind will seek glory, wealth and fame within Kerafyrm's former place of imprisonment and the Ancients will be upon the end goals for all that enter. I will not discourage you or your kind from such a course of action -- for your lives are your lives alone to endanger and discard as you wish. However, if those of your kind whom remain loyal to the Claws of Veeshan are [of the mind to engage in such a battle] and if the fates extend their pity upon you, then perhaps you shall be of aid to us yet.");

For our efforts to be of any due worth, we need one sample from each dragon, and each Crusader must be given the particular representation of their duty by one whose spirit and disciplines are paralleled. If you are a warrior among your kind -- one who wields steel in battle for reasons of either faith, honor, or repute among your shallow little world, mind that I care nothing for what your kind deem as dark or corrupt for the soldiers upon a battlefield are all fundamentally identical in their foundation, then I shall ask that you return your [findings] to me.");

However, be warned that the Ancient's forms are unpredictable and we are not certain what will remain intact once their essence and consciousness have fled their forms and you may find yourself standing before the lifeless form of a monstrous behemoth, but the mighty claw you seek may be too damaged or deteriorated from the sudden loss of its life-giving essence.");
