Apparently, the temple called Qvic is where the Muramite army first broke through. The temple was ravaged by the force of the explosion when the portal to the Muramites' realm closed. Of course, as you know, they are not the only thing that came through the portal. The strange magic stones we discovered were also a result of that explosion and up until now we thought we had found the most powerful ones. After going through the reports, I found out that concentrated pieces of the magic-imbued [" . quest::saylink("matter") . "] lie in the Qvic temple area and beyond.");

I have come to call them shards of power because of the odd shapes they take. They must have their power removed and condensed before they can be applied to an item. I have figured out a way to do this, but another [" . quest::saylink("drawback") . "] has prevented me from testing my theory further.");

In other words, the materials that make up an item determine if these shards are compatible with it.

It is a powerful item that can be made even more powerful with my help and yours, but this will require the help of many and I am afraid we do not have the force to take on such a task. Do you think you would be willing to collect the four shards of power from the temples and bring them to me as you get them?");

Within each of these you should find a shard of power. The hard part will be finding one as the Muramites are aware of the power within them and are hoarding every piece they find. If my theory is correct, you will have to combine the shards in a particular order before the stone will become attuned with another. You should retrieve the shards from the temples in the order I said before -- Qvic, Inktu'ta, Txevu, and Tacvi. Give each shard to me one at a time so that I can remove and condense the magic for you and then you can combine them in the special sealer. Now, hurry! I am worried that the leader of the Muramites may realize he needs to get rid of these shards, before we can get our hands on them.");
