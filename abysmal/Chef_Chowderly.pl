Chef Chowderly gives a cold glance to his assistant Throgar who is standing in a small pile of broken dishes. 'I swear he drops more dishes than he cleans!

I think I will need a lot of dishes. If you can, take this note to my friend Rellix in Rivervale. He owes me a favor and should be able to give you some dishes.
