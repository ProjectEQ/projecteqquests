The second tapestry was of a beautiful waterfall and stream found deep in the mountains of Kuua. Even though it was just a picture, it exuded an undeniable sense of peace. The third tapestry was of one of my favorite dragorn heroes, Jayruk the Hunter. It showed Jayruk standing over the corpses of his favorite kill, the bazu. If you could return these to me I would be inexpressibly grateful to you.");
