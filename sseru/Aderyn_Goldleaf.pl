Tracking is an invaluable tool at times though so our ways continue to be passed on. There is no way that [Katta] Castellium can match our tracking skills. What are you look... ah, I see you are eyeing my quiver. It is the Jeweled Quiver of the Hand. It is given to each ranger that is in the Hand's Ranks. ");

You are just right. They would not question one from Norrath. If you with to prove your worth and earn your own Quiver go to Katta. Galren Fuzzytoes is know to us to be a spy, but we can never catch him. Surely it will be easier to find him within his own city. Defeat him, and retrieve any report that he is taking back to their Governors.");
