These antagonists seem to prefer attempts at corrupting people from within our ranks. Weak minds are inevitable, so corruption is unavoidable. That is why the Eye is necessary. We are not here to pry or spy on anyone. We simply maintain the security of our sanctum and weed out any unsavory elements. If you're interested in learning more about [the Eye], I can assign you a [simple task] or two.");

When you do so, please remove the coin that you will find in his pocket and bring it to me. Accomplish this task without error and I may have a special task for you. Take care not to get caught. I would prefer the swap remain a suprise for him to discover on his own.");

We do not need to bring attention to the Eye in this matter. Once you have poured the poison into Ornis' ear, he will be unable to move. Just place the coin that you took from Consis on Ornis' body and leave. Bring me the empty poison vial, so that I can be sure that no evidence was left behind. Once that is done, we can deal with his contact.");

I'm not sure that you understand, so please allow me to elaborate. The coin that i handed you has great value. That value is obvious in the fact that the coin is made of a precious metal and carries with it more wright than a standard coin. That said, you did not take the coin for your personal gain. You simple carried out your purpose. The fact that you can be trusted has earned you that coin. Do you understand the [meaning of the task] now?");

We need people who display not only integrity, but trust. Trust in our purpose here and you will do well. Out means may seem a bit harsh at times, but we are here to protect our people from an enemy whose methods are without honor.

Your willingness to assist us with this most unpleasant task is a great display of allegiance. We are very excited about your future with us, but let's finish with this before we talk further. Take this poison and do with it as you did to Ornis. This time the target is a guard within Katta Castellum. His name is Erallic. Find him when he is asleep after a guard shift and kill him. Be sure to bring me the empty vial and be careful. They will have guards posted. Stealth is key in this matter. Take care.");
