The Plane of Knowledge, as I am certain you are already aware, holds more than mere tomes and legends. Knowledge goes far beyond that of scholarly intellect and research -- it extends to all mediums of skill and study, including the arts of the tradesmen. I am Higwyn Matrick, a warden of the Great Mother in my youthful days. As time passed and nature's grip upon me became gray, I settled to be the tailor of my people upon Tunaria. I had tailored some of the finest garments for both noblemen and commoners alike in my day. Here, upon the Plane of Knowledge, I continue my research and performance of this art, though I do so know at this very moment as an aid to all tailors that might pass before me. If you happen to hold an active interest in this art, then do not hesitate to search my wares. I may hold something of value and use to you yet.");
