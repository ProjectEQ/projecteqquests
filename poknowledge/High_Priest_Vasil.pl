If you have come in search of a mentor to guide you through the skills of your priesthood, then do not be discouraged by my own declaration of faith should it differ from yours. I cannot teach you how to know and be close to your deity in life, for only you may know that individually, but I can impart to you the fundamental basics that every priest, despite the object of their undying faith and devotion, wields in their life of service.'");
