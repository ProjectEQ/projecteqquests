## Changes by Kagehi.
## $Shar_Vahl_Cit tracks the steps you take to gain your initiate cloak.
## Since we don't want to hand people things that they can't normally get, or
## stuff they haven't earned, we need to track which stage in the quest they
## are at. 1 = Citizen Application. 2 = Cert. of Taxability, 3 = Stamped Cert.,
## 4 = Note to King Raja, 5 Note 'from' the king, 6 = Notarized Application
## and 7 = Initiate's Cloak.
