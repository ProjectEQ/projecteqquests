Life, nature and even the elements are so obvious. There is no mystery greater than death and to control and command it is a reward greater than most will know... but you will learn! Renn to the Bloodreavers, youngling. I can teach you many skills, so I expect i will see you soon. And take this robe of our guild to protect you as you learn to command death itself. I highly recommend you see Innkeeper Fathus and Initiate Dakkan for work inside the city. Udra, bloodreaver.");
