It is my theory that they were some form of religious or supernatural ritual area. I don't know what happened, but there are ghostly sightings there nearly every night. I have been studying them but thus far have had no luck in gaining anything solid that I can bring back for extensive study. I have seen some strange essence left behind, however. If you could bring me a few of those, say four? It would be most helpful. I may even have a mace in it for you.");
