Then, suddenly, he was surrounded by dozens of dark elves. He was captured and taken to the Dead to be experimented upon and had his soul twisted by vile necromantic magics. Then the Tier'Dal cast his remains to the winds. Where they landed, no one knew, until now. You have found one of his bones. I hereby charge you with a Holy Quest to bring this Hero's bones back for a burial with honors. Do you [accept], knight?");

A spy of ours within Neriak was able to surmise that six of his bones along with his sword and shield were scattered throughout Norrath. You must search far and wide to find the remaining pieces, as you already have one.. Do not give up. It is now your sacred duty. Once you have retrieved all eight pieces, come back to me and inform me that you [have all the bones].");
