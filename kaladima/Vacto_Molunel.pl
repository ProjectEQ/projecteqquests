While my specialty is making [scarab helms]. I have also been convinced to make [scarab breastplates] and [scarab boots] from time to time.  All of the pieces I craft are to dwarven proportions. but I have had some gnomish and halfling customers as well.  They come from all over for my armor.");

I am afraid I could only make you a helm if you were to provide me with the two scarab carapaces necessary to accommodate a head such as yours.  I will also need a payment of 5 gold pieces.  The Butcherblocks are crawling with worker scarabs that have just the right size carapaces for our needs.");
