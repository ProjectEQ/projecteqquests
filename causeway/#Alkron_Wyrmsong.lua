We soon found ourselves under siege from a dark army.  While we were surprised by their initial appearance, we Dragorn are not weak and were able to fight them back to the portal itself after years of war.  Ten years to the day after the opening of the portal, mere days before we would have been able to destroy the portal, Oshiruk first set foot on our world.  Oshiruk was rumored to be a dark deity from a reality overcome with discord long ago and that he had come to power by consuming the other deities of his pantheon.

The priests of Vesagran stood stalwart at the gates of our city and that day our god answered us.  A great cry was heard and great crystalline wings flapped across the city blowing up an enormous cloud of dust.  The titans clashed and ultimately Oshiruk fell that day before the fury of the crystalline dragon.  As he struck the ground, Oshiruk's body was consumed in [" .. eq.say_link("darkness") .. "].")

When the tentacles finally died away, all that was left of the mighty Oshiruk was his infamous dark armor.  The chestplate held a black orb that crackled with dark lightning.  The dragon reached forward and tore the orb from the chestplate, causing a cataclysmic backlash of evil energy.  She collapsed to the ground, overcome by the dark energy.   The priests of Vesagran were able to protect her from the remnants of Oshiruk's army, but were not able to keep them from taking the black armor back through the portal to discord.  But Vesagran held the orb, and with it the spirit of Oshiruk.  The orb and Vesagran have never been seen again until today.  How it might be destroyed I don't know, but should the armor ever be reunited with the [" .. eq.say_link("orb") .. "] Oshiruk would surely return and destroy us all.")

But he requires a body in order to resurrect himself into this existence.  He certainly wants to reform his former self and to that end will try to find the breastplate, gauntlets and boots of his previous armor.  There may be a way to destroy his former body at least.  The power of Mata`Muram is vast, perhaps we can use these two evils to destroy each other.  Bring me the armor and a globe of discordant energy from the lair of Mata`Muram and I will attempt to destroy the armor and prevent Oshiruk's return.")
