With the help of the texts provided me by the dragon-kin here in Skyshrine I have narrowed my search down to a few locations where I believe the artifacts I seek may be hiding. Before the artifacts may be recovered however you will need a special container in which to store them in. They are quite old and who knows what condition they may be in. I am missing some materials that are necessary for the insulation of the container thus it would be appreciated if you could provide me with a [crystalline silk mesh] and two [oily goo secretions] I will finish the construction of the artifact container and provide with the information I have obtained of the lost artifacts.");

It is my assumption that the magically adepts sirens of Sirens Grotto may now be in possession of the scale.");

The legends claim that the dragon that wore this claw had the ability to swiftly carve powerful runes into the surface of any object. These runes were apparently some form ancient spellcrafting art and it is said the dragon, Ulvaxazoviak, who for a time possessed the claw would carve runes of protection and power into his own scales. When Ulvaxazoviak's spirit finally fled this realm he was buried in the Dragon Necropolis, which is where I believe the golden dragon claw has rested to this day.");
