Many have passed through these ruins and this had never been discovered by anyone. It must have been hidden for a reason and as such I told my brothers that we should leave it here as it could bring more bad then good. That's when something [happened] I was not prepared for.");

They begin to argue back and forth and then a small scuffle broke out between the two. I tried to break it up, but before I could I heard the paper rip in two. Standing across from each other with a torn piece of paper in their hands they looked at me and gated home leaving me here in danger and very [worried].");

Hopefully it will help them understand why the information contained on that piece of paper must be kept here. Finding them will not be easy but I can tell you that Stiggles use to spend a lot of his time alone in a dragon graveyard inhabited by phase spiders. Tani may be near the home of the Sarnaks, he was looking into some intriguing discovery around there before he decided to accompany me here. They should give you the piece they have and then I will need you to bring them back here to me so I can fix this mess.");
