A lot of people were disappointed when we had to condemn Zimel's Blades. All the merchandise was handed over to Groflah Steadirt. Mostly charred junk.");

They were apparently avid travelers before settling down here in Freeport. I guess it was during their travels that they picked up the fine arts of the forge. You should talk to Groflah about Zimel. He can tell you more than I can.");

    quest::say("About a week after Ariska Zimel's disappearance, strange noises were heard from his shop. Loud booms and rumbling as though the earth itself were exploding. When the militia got to the shop, they said the shop was badly burned by an exploding boiler. They had us condemn the building due to its unsafe structure");
