It is told that Xervolithax fell to the Kromzek centuries ago in the Great Divide in a great battle. The only surviving apprentice of Xervolithax that survived the fateful incident recovered the tome from the fallen dragon sorcerer and divided it into [sections], which he then hid for fear of the tome falling into the hands of the Kromzek magic-users.");

The pages of the tome are a thick durable parchment, possibly magically preserved, and the ancient dragon script was penned in the blood of the author. Here is a binding that can be used to store the sections of the tome should you come across them in your explorations. If you find all the sections of the tome return the complete tome to me and I will reward you for your assistance with treasures from the Skyshrine coffers.");
