You need four things, magical clay, a body part from the animal you wish to befriend, something on the subject that you wish to know about and some water. You also need to use a kiln, so I hope you are a talented potter. Now, this only works on the animal from which the body part is taken or one of its direct descendents. You may have to try a lot of animals to find the right one.");

Gators eat just about anything, so there's a chance you can find one that knows where that intruder with the grass ended up if you can get an alligator to tell you where it's eaten. I'd suggest a good slab of the best piranha meat you can find. It's worth a try. At this point any help would be good. I've been looking at this disease and it is nasty in a subtle way. It barely infects the plants, causes them little harm, but it spreads quickly. So quickly, in fact, that it must be magical. We need more information to stop it.");
