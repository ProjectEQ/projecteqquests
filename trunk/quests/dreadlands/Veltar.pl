#Velter gives us the last shackle in the line, the Shackle of Tynonnium. Since players must turn in their Shackle of Steel to the tome keeper in Kaesora to complete Veltar's quest, there is no requirement to check for it here.

Agility is very important in showing your ability to avoid blows sent your way, and then returning what was sent to you. Without striking quickly you are no monk at all. Peace of mind will allow you to concentrate on the situation you are in. With it you can control your actions and make decisive strikes at critical times. Without peace of mind you may attack out of rage and will surely fall for your mind is clouded. You must complete these three trials to earn the shackle of the Grandmaster.");
