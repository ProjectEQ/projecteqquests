Don't you know that this is the district of Kartis -- the center of the shaded voice of mortal power in the known universe? Perhaps you stumbled into the darkness by accident -- but then, why would not your deity of pure light, justice, valor, and honor deter you from this place? Perhaps they have abandoned you, or perhaps you have been subject to the true face value of their illusion.'");

Serve them with your life and go to the same place that all mortals go when they perish, despite their dogmatic affiliations. Indeed, I stand here on my own accord -- my faith is in myself and in my power and thus is how I fuel the shadow.  Perhaps this is a life more suited for you -- for it is a shame to see all that conviction and head-strong will go to waste, now isn't it?'");
