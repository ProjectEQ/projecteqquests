Our initial encounters with them revealed that each one is innately resistant to certain weapon types and weak against others. So, by order of Morden, we must gather skin samples from each race and analyze them. Thanks to our tinkering sister, Vaifan, I now have a device which can readily examine samples. However, with news of our scouts missing and our resources being spread so thin, retrieving these samples is impossible for us. Since you've taken the time to listen, I'm wondering if you would be [willing to help] or [not]?" );

When you defeat a Muramite, remove his tongue, place it inside of here, and combine it with some distilling salts. Distilling salts can be found along the shores of Natimbi. Once you have combined the ingredients, it will give you a final sample which I will need you to return to me when you get the chance. Each time you hand me a sample, I will be able to reveal to you the innate strengths and weaknesses for that race. If you are successful in recovering a sample from every different race that has come through the portal, then I will talk to Morden about giving you a reward." );
