The kobolds fear them and rightly so for many dogs have fallen to the pure elemental might these creatures control. By harnessing this power, I believe I can produce a temper that once infused into a weapon will allow the owner to wield the very essence of fire itself. To create this temper, though, I need [raw materials].");

I'll need parts from four different types of creatures to produce the temper. We've spoken long enough. You must go before you alert the kobolds to my presence. Return to me only once you have the materials.");
