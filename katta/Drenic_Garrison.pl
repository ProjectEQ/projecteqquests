The effects on our people were devastating at first but over the years we have become more accustomed to life on this moon. Still, if we were able to eradicate these diseases and poisons entirely many lives would be saved. The damp subterranean Fungus Grove and Paludal caverns are among the most infested areas. If you brave those dank passageways and return with a Muck Beetle Mandible, Black Fungal Fiend Spores, Green Fungal Fiend Spores, and a Grimfang Poison Sack I will gladly take them to the researchers for further study and experimentation.");

Some time ago our scouts cooperating with powerful members of the Magus Conlegium attempted to chart the expanses of the barren treacherous region. During this excursion the scouts and magi encountered a small group of strange snake like men. The magi detected no magical aid that was allowing the creatures to move freely in the airless void without danger of suffocation. When approached the snake men quickly fled. We wish to know how these creatures survive in such conditions. If they prove to be a hostile species then we will have to resort to examining their [anatomy].");
