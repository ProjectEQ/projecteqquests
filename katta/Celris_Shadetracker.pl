I was of the original members of the Combine Empire to arrive here on Luclin and have since become quite familiar with its many lands and their inhabitants. I used to travel extensively but in my old age I have found comfort in remaining here at the Tsaph Katta Hall telling younger explorers of my many journeys and teaching them of the [dangers] that abound.");
