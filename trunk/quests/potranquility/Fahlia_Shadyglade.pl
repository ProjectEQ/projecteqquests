As I was walking out of the shop, I heard a distant moan. I walked toward the source and found Tylis lying by the reflecting pool. The pool was different, though. It now had a small [black cube] floating over it. I tried to wake Tylis but was not successful. I then brought him here and have been caring for him since.'");

I sense that if you were to try to help you may befall the same fate as poor Tyllis. Perhaps you should become more experienced in travelling through the planes before you learn more about his condition.");
