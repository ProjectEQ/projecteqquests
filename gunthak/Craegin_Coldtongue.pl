He draws a circle around them, presumably to show that they are connected somehow. Craegin looks up at you and points to the wolf and then at you. You think he is asking if you are a Beastlord. His gaze pierces your eyes waiting for an answer.");

He reaches into the bag and pulls a bit of the mixtures out. Unexpectedly he blows the mixture into your face, causing your eyes to burn and your lungs to uncontrollably cough in pain.
