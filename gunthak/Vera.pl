The breeze here is quite refreshing. To be honest, though, I already miss home and wish to return back as soon as I can. These pirates are quite dirty and smelly, but I must complete my [mission] before I return home.");

At one moment she is hot and raging to the touch and the next she is as cold as the deep sea. If such an illness is impossible for the priests to cure, I must cure her in the only way I know how. I came out here to investigate the way the waters of Gunthak cool the hot lava coming from under the volcano of Broken Skull. The mixing of these two elements sometimes causes powerful elementals to manifest themselves here. I have a feeling that, by mixing the elements of the sea and the elements of the lava, I can make a potion that will soothe my sister. [Will you help] me?");

Go and dispatch these followers of hate and return to me a flicker of lava and a flicker of sea. Please hurry! I know not how long my sister can hold out!");

Not only do they control the slaves, but they have also found a way to make them stronger. I suspect if you could get me some of the substance that the luggalds use to stoke the flames of strength in their slaves, I could find a way to transform it into a form we could use on the elementals of our craft. Are you willing to take a chance and make a [dangerous journey]?");

The pattern is burned into your vision, even when you close your eyes. Knowing that the runes will fade, you quickly pluck up a pen and parchment to jot the runes down.
