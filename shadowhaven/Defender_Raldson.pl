A very brave gnome he is, but also sometimes not very aware of what he is getting himself into. He told me that he needed to bring it to Zimloro so that a potion could be made to cure his sick sister. She was attacked by one of the cursed not too long ago. Perhaps you could go [lend him a hand] so that he could return sooner. His family is very worried about him.");

If you are to go search for him, please bring him this note from Zimloro that contains further instructions. Please seek him out and do your best to convince him to come home.");
