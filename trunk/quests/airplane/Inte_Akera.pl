I have fought for the causes of good. I gained the esteem of kings and lords. The sword I hold is but one example of the treasures I have sought and won. I have accomplished all that I can, have all that I desire. My toil is done and now I sit among the clouds in peace, occasionally blessing those who seek it and are found worthy.");

Be warned however, if I do not think as you do, I will simply accept the item as a gift, and give you no blessing.");
