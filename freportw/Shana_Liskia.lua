You'll need two components. One will increase the power of the mixture, something with a lot of magical power. It needs to be a liquid or powder to integrate properly. And you'll need a stabilizer, something to help the mixture and the new material to remain stable. This influences the kind of attunement that the crystal takes on during the process. It should be something from nature if you want the result to suit your tastes. You'll have to find someone that knows of something about it among the druids for help on what to use.");
