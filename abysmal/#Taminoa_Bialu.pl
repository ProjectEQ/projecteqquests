Based off of early information, we believe each area had a specific purpose. I am still trying to decipher the native language to figure out what the names mean, but going off of visual information I can assume that Qinimi served as their court, Riwwi is where they held games, Barindu was a lush garden, and Ferubi was a central place of worship once. That is about the extent of my information as far as the intended purpose of each area. What they are now used for I can explain in further detail. Which area would you like to hear more about?");

I assigned this area to Talwin, a young wood elf new to the brotherhood. He was a proven scout eager to assist. Initially things were going well, but the information he was sending was not helping much. I think this worried him and resulted in him pushing his luck a little far. Ever since I told him his reports were lacking the vital evidence we needed I have not heard from him. Before Falcin passed on, I asked him if he had found anything out about Talwin and he shook his head. I know Talwin is still alive . . . he has to be . . . and I know that there must be some clues in the area of Barindu somewhere. He was diligent about recording what he found so I would assume that if he has been captured that his writings must be lying around the area somewhere.

While I cannot make out most of it, Kreshin has translated some of it and it appears to be a description of a ritual one of the head ikaav performs regularly. Apparently she has been trying to absorb the geomantic powers of the natives of Taelosia. The details are kind of sketchy as Kreshin was only able to translate so much, but some information is better than none, I always say. Anyway, it says here that the ritual is conducted in the Chamber of Souls. It used to be a large tower which the natives used to watch the shores. The tower was destroyed when the invaders took over the area and converted it to a ritual chamber. They used it in experiments centered on the extraction of magic. The head ikaav, known as Xictic, has been trying to use the powers of the native Taelosians to build an army of stone workers that he can directly control instead of relying on the ability of slaves. During the ritual, Xictic stands atop a platform which is suspended over a circle of platforms. The center platform holds an inanimate stone worker while eight ikaav stand on smaller platforms around the center. What happens next is not really known, but the end result is three lifeless slave corpses. According to this, she has not yet been successful, which I would say is good news. But if we do not stop her, she could easily reinforce the numbers with stone workers tainted by the touch of this legion. I know you have accomplished your goal, but I must ask that you find a way into this ritual and silence Xictic for good. Show this to Nislan. He should be able to decipher the images. I believe this is the key to getting into the ritual chamber. Now, hurry please and return to me with proof of Xictic's death so that I can make a final report on the Qinimi area to Fezbin.");

Hm . . . here at the bottom he gives details about the weapon master. Seems he only enters the Ferubi area to fix the weapons that his four elite guards use. Knowing this, I am sure we can trick him into appearing.
