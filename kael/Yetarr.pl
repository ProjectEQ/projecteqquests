I have advised King Tormax to send Kromzek raiding parties to raze Thurgadin, however, each time he reminds me that our strongest warriors must stay to guard against the dragon menace. What I need is a band of mercenaries to seek out and assassinate key Coldain leaders. We must destroy their ability to make war.");

Bring me their heads, I will reward you for each one. That is the only proof I will take of their deaths.");
