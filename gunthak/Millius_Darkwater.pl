One of our [clerics] took a small group out in search of him, but we have received no news from either group.");

Clerics of Prexus are required to carry with them a Deepwater Emblem to identify them, if nothing else I hope to find Alina's Emblem to return it to Erudin.");

I can sense the spirit of one of our order nearby. It is in terrible torment, I suspect Chester's spirit has been bound here by the dark curse of Innoruuk. You must find him and set him free.
