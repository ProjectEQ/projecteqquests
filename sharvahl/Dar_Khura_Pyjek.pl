[Spiritist Ragnar] has supplied me with the means to create an anti venom, but I will need one of their stingers in order to do so. If you bring one of their stingers to me, I will cure you of such poisons.")

If you happen to find any of their glands, it would be a tremendous help to him if you could supply him with some of these glands. Use caution, for there is a deadly one still roaming out there. We call him [Tailfang]. I would suggest steering clear of this little sucker? he is particularly nasty.")

I was searching for bluecapped mushrooms among the stones when I saw something shiny underneath one of the rocks. As I got closer to look, Tailfang sprung at me with a dagger in hand no less! I swear this on my honor, although I still cannot believe it myself. I tried to slay the little bugger, but he ran off. I did get his dagger though, it's yours if you bring me proof of his death.")
