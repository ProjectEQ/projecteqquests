He was recently sent into the heart of Kael Drakkel on a very important mission and has not returned. He is now long overdue, and fearing the worst, our wise council has asked me to dispatch a rescue party to determine what has become of him and return him to safety. I have decided to give you this opportunity to build upon the trust you have earned from the council. Will you accept this mission?");

Unfortunately, I have neither the time, nor the components to fashion the next few shawls for you. Ask Rexx Frostweaver about the prayer shawl and follow his direction carefully.");
