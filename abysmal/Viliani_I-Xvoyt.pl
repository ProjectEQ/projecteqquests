I am collecting the contents of internal organs pulled from the Muramites. Killing them appears to be a difficult task, so their organs are hard to come by. The only one that we've been able to figure out at all seems to be a waste-product storage organ. I haven't seen one inside one of the creatures, so I can't confirm what function is serves for them, nor do I really care. We have decided to call that waste product, bile. The bile can be extremely toxic, even more so than some of the Muramite blood we've found. So, if you can do some [simple things] for me, I can investigate the [Muramite bile].");

It's interesting that the different races all have this dangerous bile. It appears that this organ is underdeveloped in many of these creatures, though. I suspect it has to do with their maturity. I believe that it develops much more slowly than the rest of their bodies. Only the older ones will have bile sacks. Bring me a bile sack and I will extract the bile for you and give it to you stored properly. I will keep a portion of the bile for my own research as payment for my efforts.");
