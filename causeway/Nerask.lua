When the Muramites came he protected me by hiding me amongst some rubble, but I should have protected him . . . Should have done something. My master was so kind to me. Please do me a favor so that I may serve him one last time. I need to gather my master's favorite [belongings] to give his soul peace, but as a poor serf I stand little chance of doing so.'");

He told me that it contained a jewel at the top of the staff that was the essence of a whispering spirit which would guide him on his long journeys. I do not know where my master got the stick from as he had it long before I entered into his service. Please return his walking stick to me as it truly was one of his most-favored possessions. I will also need two small bars of Nashtar berry soap so I may clean and preserve it as I once used to. Do this and I shall give you an enchanted cap befitting a dragorn elder.'");

One such being took a locket that was given to my master by his father that was in a special pouch. This pouch was no doubt also stolen for the embossing it contained. It was truly fine work indeed. Bring me this pouch so I may retrieve my master's locket from within it and I will give you some fine cloth sleeves that my master wore when performing his duties as a dragorn elder. In addition, I will need two spools of Balemoon silk thread which I will use to size the sleeves to you.'");

So on that appointed day, when our remaining forces marched upon the Muramite force stationed near the portal, a bloody battle ensued. Though our valiant warriors were vastly outnumbered, their courage and skill allowed them to turn the tide against the invaders. Then the portal collapsed and exploded, destroying everything in its path -- Muramites and dragorns. We are not sure why this happened, but I think we were betrayed by the riftseekers. Bring back one of these riftseeker hearts and two riftseeker trinkets so I know we have struck back at them. Do this and I will give you an enchanted cloth bracer that befits a dragorn elder such as my master.'");

He fell during a tremendous battle against the Muramites and to honor him, one of my master's last wishes was to recover his axe. I will give you a pair of enchanted cloth gloves if you find me this axe and two Kuuan whetstones so I may honor Makyah, and thus my master.'");

In fact, just a few days prior to being taken, he told me that he was expecting a note that could change the very face of the war. The carrier of this message was none other than Jayruk himself. No one knows what happened to Jayruk because he did not show up with the note. I will give you my master's ceremonial robe if you can find Jayruk's vest and bring it back to me. I am sure that hidden within it lies the note my master was so anxious about. In addition, I will need three pieces of Vrenlar fruit which I will need to uncover the hidden message.'");
		elseif(e.message:findi("leg")) then
		  e.self:Say("Upon becoming a lauded elder, my master was given a ceremonial amulet recognizing his status. Though it was not magical in the least, he did not cherish it any less. After my master was taken, our house was ransacked and one of the Muramites took the amulet as a trophy. Return this amulet to me and three pieces of softened feran hide so I may create a small pouch to protect the amulet.'");
		elseif(e.message:findi("feet")) then
		  e.self:Say("I have heard that the Muramites have taken over the labyrinth used by our elders. This was once a serene retreat where our elders would meditate and be guided by the spirit of the Great Father. Now, the labyrinth is infested with Muramites. They call it their 'Proving Grounds' where they test their viciousness. The vilest of them are rewarded with Muramite Cruelty medals that signify that they destroy everything they touch. I want you to return one of these medals to me so that at least one of these dark creatures has been suitably dealt with. Also, bring me two Ikaav tails so I know that these vicious creatures have also been dealt a blow.'");
