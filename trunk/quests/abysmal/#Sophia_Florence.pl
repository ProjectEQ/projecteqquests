De'van mentioned that he had told someone of my worries and now here you are with the final writings of my father. You are truly a blessing sent by the Gods and I thank you once again, but I must ask that you do the same for the others who are worried about the loved ones that traveled with my father. If you have already helped everyone please tell De'van that your task is complete and he will reward you.");
