I had always had a knack with golem creation, but it was a most difficult task to create a golem of the power that the Overlord wanted due to their physiology. After much intense research I had finally documented a way to create what I think could be the most powerful golem ever created. It was all detailed in my [tome].");

Gaodon had broken through the fence leading to the breeding pens of the Royal Family's most vicious chokidai. Gaodon was promptly torn limb from limb. A fitting end for him! However the chokidai also got hold of my tome. They began to tear it apart. Dodging their gnashing teeth, I managed to recover the remains of the tome. However some of the pages were missing. The chokidai, seeing that their pen was now open, fled into the tunnels. As the chokidai escaped, I noticed that some of them had pages from my tome dangling from their maws. This happened recently so there may still be [hope] in recovering the pages.");
