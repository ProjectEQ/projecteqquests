At their whim, the fiendish beasts lance us with their icy spears. The cold chill bites and the pain is horrible. In fact, there are still fragments of the dark ice embedded in my scales from their last attack. I believe they only mean to torment and not kill us, as so far there have been few deaths. Now that you understand our plight, what is it you want from me?'");

I will accept nothing else.");
