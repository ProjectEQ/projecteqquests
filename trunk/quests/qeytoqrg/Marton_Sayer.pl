The spell would help you fight off disease and call forth a wolf to fight beside you. Alas, the gnoll eye was stolen from the blade by a great, one-eyed, white gnoll. Alone with the eye, the only book which explained how to return the enchantment was also stolen. I know not where this gnoll might be. If you can find the journal and the eye, return them with the Gnoll Slayer to me for I have been searching for decades.");
