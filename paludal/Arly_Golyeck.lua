In return for what you want, you can help me with my pressing issues. First and foremost, I could use a bit of cash to help run things around here. It's been hard times for me and the boys, and the money from a pouch of gems would keep us well fed, well armed, and our enemies well bribed for quite awhile.

It involves using an extremely potent poison agent, mixing it with a thin lacquer, and making sure the combined solution seeps into each tiny groove of the metal.
