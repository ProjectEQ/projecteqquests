This is a most exciting time as we will be the first to record the history of this new race of dragonkind. Could there be a greater honor? You must sing great songs of the virtues of Veeshan and The Six, our parents, so that the bloodline of the dragons will last for eternity. So, renn to the Weavers of Legend, my friend, and take this tunic for your travels. I highly recommend you see Innkeeper Fathus and Initiate Dakkan for work.  They are located in the city.  Udra, for now.");
