#Beginner Magic Manual
#
#As a note, according to posts at Alla's (not the most reliable source I know, 
#but all I've got right now) the Beginner's quests eat the Planar Traveler's Manual, 
#so that quest must be completed 3 times in order to do all the Beginner's Manual 
#Quests.  This is intended behaviour.

It is refreshing to see so many people of different cultures coming together in harmony. don't you think?  So many shared experiences from all corners of the universe provide us with a great benefit of wisdom.  As a teacher, my job is to share the knowledge of all things mystical with eager students.  With my help I can teach you the basics of planar magic if you are [willing to learn].");

Fortunately, I happen to know of a rather rejuvenating meal that will grant new power to your condition. If you are not familiar with the recipe for [Hobgoblin Surprise], I can tell you. What you must do is bring me some as well as your Planar Traveler's Manual. I hope you won't be long, for I am beginning to get quite hungry.");

Take this book, it will certainly help you in your use of the magical arts. When you are ready, Cadelid Etord will give you your next lesson, so be sure to speak to him.
