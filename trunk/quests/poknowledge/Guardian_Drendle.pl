If you are [looking] for something. you've come to the right place.  A magically enforced peace exists throughout the city.  No one is able to wield a weapon or cast harmful magic here. making crime almost non-existent.  The city is divided into several sections -- [Kartis]. the dark district; [Tanaan]. the neutral district; [Selia]. the light district; [Jeral] Abbey. the trade plaza; and of course [Myrist]. the Great Library."); }
