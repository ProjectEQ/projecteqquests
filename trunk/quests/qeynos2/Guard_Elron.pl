#Description: The point of this quest is to locate the child. Sadly, she has been eaten by a viscious (or is that viscous?) gel cube from the Qeynos Sewers.
#You randomly find the remains of her bloodied dress on Cuburt. This was a boon to low level int casters as the reward was randomly (I recall one in 5 ish) a +3 int earring.
#Personal note: EQEmu spawn/drop rate on the dress from Cuburt is awful, compared to live, so I have upped the "good" reward to 35% chance.
#Other NPCs that you can hand the dress into: Zamel, South Qeynos; Endric, South Qeynos

I have told her a million times to stay out of the aqueducts..  She never listens..  Now I spend every free moment searching for my little girl, if only I could find some clue to her fate. Well, I need to get back to work. Fare well, $name."); }

Oh, here, take this - it belonged to her mother. She always said that in times of need, it gave her courage to go on. Thank you for your help, but I'd like to be alone now.");
