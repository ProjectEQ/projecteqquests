I am sure you have heard our story, there are several others on this ship who have been awaiting the return of the 14 adventurers who set out to stop the Force Commander, one of them was my son Maddoc. While I am close to giving up, I would at least like to have something of his to remember him by. Something I can keep with me so I know somehow he is still looking out for me.") ;
