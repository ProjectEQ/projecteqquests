The last letter I received from him was written in a desperate scrawl. His tone was fearful and angry, which isn't like him at all. He spoke of shadows and hearing voices in his head. I'm afraid he may have done something rash. Something horrible. Don't let his frail appearance fool you, Fyredragn. He's from the same blood as Nedaria and very powerful.

In typical rogue-like fashion, they made off with most of our supplies, too. The more unsavory Wayfarer pledges were quite taken with her striking beauty and her skill with a blade.

I swear I'll throw shackles on the next walking panic attack that whimpers about wanting to go back to their home. It goes without saying that Larithim was a roguish type and I wouldn't put it past him to do something rash and stupid.

Her dedication to the Wayfarer's cause wavered noticably whenever he was about. Last time I saw them, Durgin and Sharalla were preparing for [some foolish expedition]. They took a cadre of my best people, ventured off in search a 'great threat' to Norrath and haven't been seen since. I trust Durgin about as far as I can pitch an orc.

I'm inclined to say it was the former, but with this war on the horizon we can't be too careful. Having another thief slip out of sight is not something we can afford to ignore.
