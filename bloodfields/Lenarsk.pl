They would come from far away seeking my shop, clamoring for my wares. But alas, the Muramites changed all of this when they infected our lands. Fate can be harsh at times. And yet here you are. Perhaps our mutual goals will encourage us to walk the same [path] together.");

I know that you alone will not be enough to rid our lands of these invaders, but any sorrow you can cause them will bring me unending joy. Help me in my cause to wound the Muramites and I will repay your courageous deeds with some of my unfulfilled [orders].");

Alas, both father and son fell victim to the wicked Muramites and were forcibly marched through the causeway to their deaths. In exchange for the cap, I seek the walking stick of a certain dragorn elder that also perished during the march. I have heard rumors that the stick was enchanted such that were it to be lost it would find its way back to its owner. You must bring back Patorav's walking stick to me. Also, the Muramite guards that gleefully killed our leaders were given awards. Find me two Muramite Noble's March awards as well.");

I can't stand the thought of that Muramite with a gift meant for a loved one. Please return this pouch to me so I know that my hard work did not benefit one as evil as a Muramite. I also ask of you to bring me back two spiked discordling collars so I know that at least some of those that destroyed my shop have been dealt with.");

I believe they are wholly creatures of magic. I have heard whispers that the heart of these beings is not the heart of a mundane beast. No, in fact, I have heard that their heart is pure magic. Bring me one of these hearts so I may find out if any of the magic within it may be used to enchant the pieces of leather raiment I create. In addition I am running low on quality feran hides so I will need you to bring me back a couple of those as well.");

Return the axe to me so that once my people see that it was found, we may find the hope and courage necessary to defeat our foes. You will also need to bring me two fine chimera hides so I may craft a sheath worthy of an axe wielded by a legend.");

Many times did Jayruk narrowly cheat death, not by the strength of spear or swiftness of bow, but by the sharpness of his mind. There was a time when a trap they laid for a pack of feral bazu failed to contain them. Enraged, the bazu began a charge toward some homes and would have surely decimated all in their path were it not for Jayruk's [quick thinking].");

Hidden by brush was a long drop which Jayruk managed to avoid by deftly jumping to one side and clinging onto the cliff face as the bazu fell one by one to their demise. A few days later though, Jayruk disappeared without a trace. Find and return this vest so that I may study the technique that created it. In addition, to honor the memory of Jayruk, bring me three bracelets made out of bazu nails.");

They stormed into my home and shop, stealing what they could and destroying everything else. One particularly nasty Muramite took great pleasure in the destruction of my home. I want you to seek it out and exact revenge. You will recognize him by an amulet he proudly wears. Return to me with this as proof that you have accomplished the task I have lain out for you. Three of the henchmen with this Muramite leader were disgusting discordlings that tormented me needlessly. See to it that this trio pays for their twisted deeds by also bringing me three discordling hooves.");

Though not the most celebrated hunter I've served, Vrago was still widely recognized as a hero for tirelessly protecting our people from the wild beasts that roam our lands. He and his cadre once saved my life as I was returning from a trip. As repayment for saving my life, I was creating some boots for him. Before I could fulfill my debt to him, the Muramites captured him and tortured him in their twisted Proving Grounds. I have been told by witnesses to this horror that the one that carried out his execution was awarded a cruelty medal for capturing him. Find the bearer of this medal and repay my debt to Vrago by dispatching him. Return the medal to me and I will give you the boots I had intended for him. To complete the boots though, I will also need two chimera gut strings.");
