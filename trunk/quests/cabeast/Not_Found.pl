The slave creations have thrived in their sanctuary for too long.  The tomes and texts they have stolen to fill their library belong us.  They are even rumored to have a text on the Sacred Khukri of Rile. the Greenmist.  If you see such a tome. you must bring it to me immediately.  May Cazic-Thule guide you!"); }
