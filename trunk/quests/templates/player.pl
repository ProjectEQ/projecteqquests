I do not know much, but I do know that in every home city and the wilds there are agents of an organization called the Wayfarers Brotherhood. They are looking for recruits . . . If you can hear this message, you are one of the chosen. Rush to your home city, or search the West Karanas and Rathe Mountains for a contact if you have been exiled from your home for your deeds, and find out more. Adventure awaits you, my friend.'");
