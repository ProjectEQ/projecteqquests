#Cursed Event - SsraTemple#This is the priamry controller for the event. There is two versions of two of the named during the cycle. #If a previous raid failed to complete the entire event, but managed to kill some of the named during the event, the next attempt will get lootless palceholders.#This prevents a group from farming begining NPC's for loot. The PH's have the exact same stats and skills, just no loot. The real version for the first NPC is #a_glyphed_covered_serpent#and it's lootless PH is #a_rune_covered_serpent. The second NPC's real version is #Vyzh'dra the Exiled with a lootless pH of #Vyzh'Dra the Banished. The final NPC, #Vyzh'dra the Cursed has no lootless PH as killing him completes the event for 5 days.## Written by Reno# my $check = 0;my $variance = int(rand(600));my $spawntime = 4320 + $variance;sub EVENT_SPAWN {  	$check = 0;	quest::settimer("cursed",60);}sub EVENT_TIMER {$check = 0;  if($timer eq "cursed") {    $check_boss = $entity_list->GetMobByNpcTypeID(162270);#cursed_one    if ($check_boss) {      $check = 1    }    $check_boss = $entity_list->GetMobByNpcTypeID(162271);#cursed_two    if ($check_boss) {      $check = 1    }    $check_boss = $entity_list->GetMobByNpcTypeID(162272);#cursed_three    if ($check_boss) {      $check = 1    }    $check_boss = $entity_list->GetMobByNpcTypeID(162273);#cursed_four    if ($check_boss) {      $check = 1    }    $check_boss = $entity_list->GetMobByNpcTypeID(162274);#cursed_five    if ($check_boss) {      $check = 1    }    $check_boss = $entity_list->GetMobByNpcTypeID(162275);#cursed_six    if ($check_boss) {      $check = 1    }	$check_boss = $entity_list->GetMobByNpcTypeID(162276);#cursed_seven    if ($check_boss) {      $check = 1    }	$check_boss = $entity_list->GetMobByNpcTypeID(162277);#cursed_eight    if ($check_boss) {      $check = 1    }	$check_boss = $entity_list->GetMobByNpcTypeID(162278);#cursed_nine    if ($check_boss) {      $check = 1    }	$check_boss = $entity_list->GetMobByNpcTypeID(162279);#cursed_ten    if ($check_boss) {      $check = 1    }	    #If one of our NoTarget NPC's is up, we do nothing    if ($check == 1) {    } 		#If none of our NoTarget's are up, and the cursed has been recently killed we do nothing	#This should not be needed but is there for extra protection against spawning outside of desired situation    if ($check == 0 && defined $qglobals{cursed_dead}) {    }		#If the event is ready, we begin by spawning our first NPC    elsif ($check == 0) {				#If the glyph was killed in a previous cycle, and the cursed was not, we spawn a lootless PH		if (defined $qglobals{glyphed_dead}) {					#Spawn the Rune Covered Serpent.
