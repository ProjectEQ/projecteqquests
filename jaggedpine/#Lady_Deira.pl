I was sent to aid in fortifying the military front to ward off the attacks of the gnolls and any other intruders that might climb through the gnolls' burrow.

They are capable scouts and unrivaled artisans who hold tradition in a sense of honor that is to be commended and respected, but they know little about war or defense. Their existence has been peaceful -- nearly tranquil in comparison and they struggle now.

The warriors, knights, rogues, and the minority of the arcane scientists loyal to The Rainkeeper and the philosophy guarded by his faithful were warmly and hospitably accepted into the already existing guildhalls of the Qeynos city proper.

It is said that the spirit of Karana himself blessed her -- guised in the form of a raging tempest that accompanied her through the campaign that would secure the Jaggedpine for our ancestors. It was then that she was bestowed the name of Tempest Guard and the circle of the Veterans of the Storm was set in-place. In her final campaign centuries past, she fell beneath the spell of the Kedge.

The young warrior found the item to be more beautiful than anything he had seen before -- more beautiful than the lush forest; more beautiful than even the great tempest that had recently scorched the earth of his people's land. The young warrior thought the rune to be a gift from the storm -- from Karana himself. He returned it to the elders of his tribe, who also found the great beauty of this simple white stone to be divine.

They felt that the great god of the storms had wished for the stone to fall into this young man's possession, and so they respectfully obliged what they interpreted to be their deity's will. As time passed and the completion of Karana's Shrine was near, the elders called upon the then able warrior to attend the final ceremony of the shrine's completion. It was then that the warrior knew the stone's purpose and as the storm was captured into the very rock of the shrine, he placed the stone upon one of the branches of the sacred tree that the shrine was built around. The lightning from the final moments of the storm was absorbed into the rune. Eventually, this rune would become a sacred symbol for all who pledge their blades to The Rainkeeper.

He would see his only heir would rise to hold the honor of Tempest Guard, however, his son would betray the Knights of Thunder. In this knight's eyes, the betrayal was not one performed out of malice; on the contrary, he felt that his slaying of the order's then senior knight was an act of pure devotion, for it was his thought that his superior had fallen into the clutches of a venomous shadow that lurks even now in the depths of Qeynos.

She would reveal to Anumnan the name of the one who had betrayed his son and the order; the name of the one who had worked beside the corrupted knight and originally painted his son as their scapegoat.

Out of respect for Anumnan, his son, and the order, we speak neither the name of our martyred brother nor that of the villain who had come so close to the Knights of Thunder's ruin. It is said that the crazed Anumnan hired several rogues to execute every ranking member of the Veterans of the Storm and return to him as proof of their demise the single, sacred rune that they wore about their necks.

Anumnan grew to believe that the corruption the rogue had spoken unto him had already seeped into the order and he began to nurture a festering lust for vengeance. Anumnan was never caught by Qeynos, but it is said that he sought refuge within the city of Freeport. Our intelligence was only able to find the remnants of Anumnan's tale reduced to that of a pitiable madman who dwells in the southern desert of Ro. Seek Anumnan and return him to the Eye of Karana's Storm that his caged spirit has sought for so long. Anumnan will also carry the rune that you seek, for as he destroyed the others, including his own, he still wears the one that had once belonged to his departed son.");
