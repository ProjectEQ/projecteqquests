From what I gather from the natives, she made an appearance after the great explosion rocked this island. They say she crawled right out of the ocean if ye can believe that. Rumor has it that she's been sleepin' for ages and the blast woke her up. Now she roams the beaches at midnight. She's not angry so much as plain famished. We've been lookin' for bands of adventurers like yerself strong enough to take her down. If ye have the skills and ye manage to best the blasted lizard, come back and speak to me.

The rest of the ring was digested in the Cragbeast Queen's stomach so ye'll have to find a suitable replacement. Keep yer eyes peeled for a ring with room for a jewel and reforge the two pieces in a jeweler's kit. Ye shouldn't need any skill as a jewelcrafter per se, so needn't worry about that.");
