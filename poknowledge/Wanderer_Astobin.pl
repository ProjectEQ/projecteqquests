    quest::say("Greetings traveler. I am Wanderer Astobin, warden of nature and guardian of Tunare's most blessed and sacred of treasures -- life and balance. I have pledged my existence to upholding this vow and even here, that vow remains. Though I no longer carry my scimitar or scout the wilds of the world as one of its many guardians, my pledge shall remain whole through my guidance of others whose pledge is akin to mine. If you are a druid -- your deity matters not -- then allow me to guide you if I may. What spells I have scribed are for you to search through and purchase should you find them worthy of your abilities. If through your travels in the outer planes you discover incorporeal items seemingly of an arcane nature, do not disregard them. I am well-trained in the ways and manner of planar magic and will be more than willing to turn these fledgling arcane items into tangible spells suited for those of druidic vows.");
