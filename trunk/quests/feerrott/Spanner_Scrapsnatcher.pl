To be honest, I've just thought about it and I think that I've had quite enough of you as well. So mate, unless you're holding my bag of fame and fortune... as promised to me last week by our huge headed friend over there... I think that it would be best if you shambled off. Please feel free to take the Erudite with you.");

Bah... you've heard the stories about the temple too, haven't ya? That is of course why you're here, right? Looking for your cut?");

		quest::say("The lass here told me that she'd be needing me to do some poking around in that temple. Of course being the handsome gentleman that I am and all, I told her that I'd take a look or two. You know a charitable and chivalrous bloke like me would perform such a task for free, but then the Errordite has to go and pry me with stories of riches and... err... a little fame. So, I says, sure... I'll do it since you're begging me and all... now look at us. Deep in the swamp and covered in black monster mucous.");

I'll be happy when I can get a nice change of clothes. If you happen into some sporty gnome sized clothing let me know.");
