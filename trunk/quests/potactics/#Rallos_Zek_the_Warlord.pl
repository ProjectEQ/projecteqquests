# Qazzaz - 03/28/10      Fixed mobs respawning during event.   * Requires plugin file GetSpawn2IDs.pl *
# Qazzaz - 03/17/10      Redid the way 03/16/10 changes were implimented using Cavedues, KLSs and Trevius' infos
#                  Using $npc->IsEngaged() for when losing agro
# Qazzaz - 03/16/10      Depops Chaos Waiths when RZ loses all agro.  No longer a all or nothing event.
#                  Depops the pit of normal mobs every 5 seconds.  No more random respawn interfering with the event for long.
