'My father is not known for giving, so I have always treasured it. I do not know what I am going to do. My ring is missing and I am sure that horrid gnome will be back for another shipment soon. Perhaps you could find it in your heart to [help] me? I am sure I could come up with some sort of compensation for such a dangerous task.");

He often came out just to taunt me and throw rocks at me. If you can find him and get my ring back, I will do all I can to find something to pay you back with. And if Ralo manages to get hurt, that would be an added bonus. Please return when you have my ring. I must get back to work. Gibson addresses his father, Sneed.
