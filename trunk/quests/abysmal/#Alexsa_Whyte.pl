Our initial encounters with them revealed that each one is innately resistant to certain types of weapons and weak against others. So, by order of Morden, we must gather skin samples from each race and examine it. Thanks to our tinkering sister, Vaifan, I now have a device which can readily examine samples. However, with news of our scouts missing and our resources being spread so thin, retrieving these samples are impossible for us. Since you have taken the time to listen, I am wondering if you would be willing to help?");

    quest::say("Oh wonderful! You don't know how helpful this will be. Take this device. It is what we use to examine samples. When you defeat the Muramite, remove his tongue, place it inside of here and combine it with some distilling salts. Distilling slats can be found along the shores of Natimbi. Once you have combined the ingredients, it will give you a final sample which I will need you to return to me when you get the chance. Each time you hand a sample, I will be able to reveal to you the innate strengths and weeknesses for that race. If you are successful at recovering a sample from every different race that has come through the portal, then I will talk to Morden about giving you a reward. Also if you forget what samples you have turned in you may come to me and say [what have I turned in] to get a list of what you have already given me to check.");
