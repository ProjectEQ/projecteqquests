'So you managed to successfully lace the Shadowed Bronze into the haft as I spoke of. Very good. I also notice this extra moonstone that wasn't here before. As to its purpose I can not speak of.' Running his sinewy finger carefully across the edge he says, 'But the edge here could still use some sharpening. Blades such as this though can not be sharpened by a normal means. No, a blade this strong will require naught but a portion of Discordant matter itself. It has been said that this matter can sometimes be found captured within the tears of those that have been tortured. Return to me only when you have succeeded in finding one. Then we will see how else I can aid thee.");

I gather you wish to learn more about it though?");

I notice the handle, however, appears to be made of a fairly strong yet flexible wood. Yet I believe the smith did not know that this metal can cause undue stress upon the handle eventually shattering it at the least convenient time, in the heat of battle. From my studies of your world I suggest lacing it with a small portion of what our people call Shadowed Bronze. I believe you can find the proper Shadowed Bronze on an ancient shade in Grieg's End. This should help to absorb much of the stress passed along from the axe head.");

Though the ore in this axe is originally from my world, the smithing technique and some of the magic are from yours. Therefore I can make no promises.' After some time and much effort the Dragorn hands the axe back. You immediately notice that edge has a brilliance to it that is nearly blinding. There outlander. I think you will be pleased with the results. The smithing technique used to forge that axe is quite unique. . .I doubt another of its kind exists. Be wary though for as I was applying the Discordant matter to the edge, I felt a disturbing presence emanating from the axe. There is someone or something that endures within it. . .something that seeks to control those who wield it. You must be ever cautious lest the axe is able to compel its influence onto you. I fear that though the axe will bring you many victories, those victories may come at a cost. Travel safe and fair, my friend!");
