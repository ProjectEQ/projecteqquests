Powerful strangers that, shall we say, do not find the Muramites to be the most tasteful of folk. I am Tibor, former officer from the Dragorn militia. It was my army that held off the Muramites at the wall during those dark days. Many fine warriors under my command [fell] to those that came out of that portal near the wall. Many more in the days after that became infected with the sickness of thought that came from the influence of Discord. Brother turned on brother, friend turned on friend.");

With your help, the dragorn can reclaim their dignity and honor by finding the courage to rise up against our enemy.

No, we must strike back, but if the Muramites learn that dragorns are behind the attacks, they will crush our resistance. But if someone else were to carry out the attacks they would have no cause to believe it was us. Therefore, in exchange for your help, I will give you several pieces of armor that I have.

Bring me this walking stick so I may see if it the rumors hold any truth because if so, this may prove very useful to my men and me. In addition to bringing me this walking stick, I need you to discretely thin out some of the kyvs in the area as I am worried that they may discover my plans.

I want you to retrieve that pouch. I also need you to perform a secondary task for me. I've noticed a concentration of Ikaav forces near the palace and maze. Weaken the Muramite forces by reducing the number of them without attracting too much attention. Bring me this embossed leather pouch and two Ikaav Heads and I will give you the sleeves.");

Both Muramite and dragorn armies clashed, neither gaining ground until one moment when a small, but brave group of dragorn warriors, managed to fight their way past the Muramite guards and slay some of their commanders. At that moment the tide of battle turned against them as the shock of their loss reverberated throughout their side.

At the moment of our greatest victory, the riftseekers had handed us our greatest loss. I would have you bring me back one of their hearts, but you must know that the heart of a riftseeker is not a heart like the one that beats with blood. No these vile beings keep their essence within a gem-like object that is often guarded by powerful beings. Bring me back one of their hearts so that my thirst of vengeance is quenched. Another source of constant irritation has been those disgusting discordlings that have overrun our lands. In addition to the heart bring me two withered discordling tongues so I know their accursed yelping has been forever silenced.");

As Makyah rolled down a shallow hill, Harnock jumped down upon him hoping to end the colossal struggle. Harnock raised the black sword above his head and struck Makyah in the chest. The impact of the black sword against the breastplate shattered the stones in the nearby walls and towers. Dragorn and Muramite alike were left stunned by the blast. Yet Makyah's breastplate held. Harnock's blade had shattered into so many glinting shards scattered across the field. Already defeated, Harnock simply smiled at Makyah as the [axe] fell upon his skull.");

You must stop the Muramite architect for us. I know little about him except that he wears a stolen dragorn amulet signifying his role as the leader of the girplans though he himself is not one.

I have heard the Muramite that killed him was awarded a medal for the cruelty he demonstrated. Bring me proof of this Muramite's demise by showing me this Muramite Cruelty medal and I will give you the boots that Ethask wore. Though it pains me to say this, I also need you to bring me back two dragorn Muramite rings. As I have said before, some of the noblest dragorn became twisted and turned against us.
