I have attempted to contact him about it, however, he seems to be avoiding me and the city of Erudin. This is not the first time that this gnome has caused trouble for the Erudites. He was arrested a while back for tampering with hatch in the Hole, releasing evil denizens from the Underfoot. If he is responsible for the disappearance, great lengths will be taken to assure the citizens of Erudin that the gnome will no longer be trouble for them.");

Perhaps if I can find someone to [help collect the research notes], the High Council may be able to determine what caused Al'Kabor's disappearance. However, only those who truly know the path the great wizard's research has taken him will know where to find the missing research notes.");

Once it is filled, seal it and take it to Noilgin Mindtune here at the outpost, so that he may deliver it to Erudin. Be forewarned though, it will be a dangerous path to follow. Most likely, the research notes have fallen into possession of some very dangerous beings.");
