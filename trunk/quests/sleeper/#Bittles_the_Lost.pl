Names of Nanzata, Tukaarak, Hraashna, and Ventani, if'n my mind serves me correct-like. When they started here, they had some other big-time dragon create the big ice creatures all over the place -- the golems, don't ya know? In any case, they upped and got kilt by some folks like you a while back, causing all kinds of panic and havoc. The ice guys were dismantled by the [new inhabitants] of this here lair and reassembled to serve them. Not that it really matters to me, I got lost here anyway and look what happened ta me!");

Well after he [went crazy], some of those other dragon-folk decided it would be good ta put him in here and put him ta sleep for all eternity.
