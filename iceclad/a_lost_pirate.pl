I heard a flappin' and squawkin' above me and I knew my time was near. So I up and jumped into a snow drift. Soon as that, somethin' swooped down where I was and started tearin' my camp up. When I came back, I saw nothin' but feathers and me torn up book. Another quarter o' me book was gone.");

Seems like everythin' that goes wrong ta me is because of some danged wild animal. I can't quite figger it.");
