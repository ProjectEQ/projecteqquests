I have been working most specifically on deciphering what portions of the strange materials may hold magical properties that could be useful to our work as Enchanters. Why, just the other day I believe I was on the verge of a great breakthrough with some odd substances I had mixed together, unfortunately I was careless and did not seal the vial tightly enough. When I awoke the next morning the [specimen] had completely evaporated.");

I noticed some of the dark priests taking cuttings from certain mushrooms, and began experimenting with that first. I discovered that they could be boiled into a salve that had the most wondrous properties for the eyes! (sighs) It will take me ages to get the [necessary components] back to pick up where I left off on that particular spell, not to mention the research that I am compiling for my [brother] to assist with his specialties. I have enough material here to keep me swamped for ages, those spells will just have to wait!");

If I have these components I believe I have the understanding to capture the essence of them within a spell, so that the effects may be recalled at will. For this I would need the stalk of one of the local mushrooms, they secrete a fluid that is useful. I also need a mermaid scale from a mermaid here in the Gulf. Are you still willing to [assist] with this?");

Then bring it to me and I will see what I can do about finishing the task. Should the mixture prove true and I unlock the secret of the potion, I will share it with you for your efforts. Be very careful however, as always in dealing with items that we are not yet fully familiar with, the materials may prove dangerous!");

He has a keen sense for the properties of stone and other such solid objects. For some time now he has been attempting to harness the power of stone for use in some form of mind control, that could be activated through a piece of jewelry. Entirely by accident, it seems that such a substance has been in use on this island for some time. It is very dangerous however, and as such most of my work has been based in theories tossed back and forth between he and I. Are you [interested] in this [strange rock] as well?");

There have been stories of miners down in the Torgiran Mines losing their wits or becoming near zombie like in their actions. I have a hunch that whatever is doing this is being harvested there. Take good care down there, I fear that the miners themselves may not be too friendly. Travel into the mines and bring me two chunks of whatever the ore is that they are gathering, be sure it is of the type that glows brightly. Most likely the miners will have a few samples, but their masters probably have a few as well. Bring these to me with an enchanted bar of gold and I can fashion a test ring from it. Be careful!");

'We have solved it! I believe I can recall this again, let me get this down for you now before the spell wears. Use it well.'
