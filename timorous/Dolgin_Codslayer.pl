The battle raged long and hard, and at the end the beast lay still among countless of the adventurers bodies. They left assuming it had been slain by their hands. But, once they left, I seen it come crawlin in this here place. They called it by the name Fayde, er, Fayred. Hrmm. What was it they called it? I can't remember.");

The dern thing's broken, bleedin, and cornered. That's a mighty deadly position to put a critter in if ye ask me. Course if yer wantin' to try it, there might be a way. Ya willin to risk it?");

He swam right into those adventurers chasin' down a wandering froglok. You wanna catch a fish, use the right bait. If only we had us some frogloks essence, then mebbe he'd come out agin. But I must warn ye laddies that the bloke over by the inn already warned me to leave all the natural critters in this here oasis in peace. He might get right mad if he sees a battle brewin' here.");
