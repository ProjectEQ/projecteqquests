I have been able to find precious little information about the Disciples activities here, but I am certain that they have a presence here. I am also fairly certain they have been meeting with the Muramites here in Discord, trying to officially join the army of Mata Muram. We need to find where they are hiding, the Muramites must have some way of contacting them, probably some sort of magical medallion. See if you can. . . coerce some Muramites into relinquishing this information. Return to me with what you find.");
