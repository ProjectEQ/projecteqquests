I lost many [friends] in those battles, and have since seen [mementos] of my childhood destroyed and left in ruins.");

Oh, the stories I could tell you about Jayruk the Hunter and his triumphs over the bazu and about Makyah the Fierce and his glorious defiance of Mata Muram and his legion. It was Makyah that served as my inspiration in the trying times that accompanied the Muramite invasion. I made a [statue] and had it in a cave where I was sent to live to serve as a reminder to all of his ideals and sacrifice.");

The Muramites apparently did not appreciate a monument to someone such as that in the city and the destroyed it right in front of me. They dragged the pieces off to some unknown ditch, I'm sure. If only I could gather the pieces again and reassemble the statue I could find some peace in the memories of that great hero.");

The arguments were small differences in opinion at first, fights over which direction the feran we were tracking went or where to camp the night. All too quickly these arguments degenerated into brawls between the two of us. It wasn't long before we had our [final disagreement].");

I had joined with Rurof the Negotiator and his army. We marched to the portal and took the Muramites by surprise. I fought for several hours before becoming grievously wounded by a kyv arrow. As I stumbled out of the battle to tend my wound, I glimpsed Zakariv for just a moment in a thick cluster of fighting seeming to just be struggling to stay alive. I was only able to see him for a moment before the bloody mobs swept him from my view. Shortly after I had left the site of the battle there was a horrendous [explosion].");
