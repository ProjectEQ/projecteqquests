I was wondering if you would mind [helping me] out? I really want to spend more time working with the newly discovered strain of local wheat. There's a wild variety of wheat that only grows in the mountainous areas, which is a very odd place for any wheat to grow, But this stuff grows there, if sparsely. The thing is, there are some very odd properties to this wheat, and with the proper technique it can be made into a very [unique flour]. So if you have a chance, I would be pleased if you could [help out]. Unfortunately, the recipes I'm working on require the use of Taelosian Wheat Flour. If you can find some Taelosian Wheat, Ordin can make flour from it. Bring that to me, and I'll have plenty of tasks for you to do.");

If you bring me some flour, we can get started. You'll have to sweat a bit before we're done, but if you're up to the task I can reward you with the secret of milling the local wheat. Because I'll be asking you to find your own supplies, I can reward you a bit sooner than Ordin will.");
