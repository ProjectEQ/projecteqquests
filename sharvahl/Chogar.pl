I'll jot a rough sketch of what I surmise the original looked like when it was intact. You can take the sketch and make a new one. It will require of you a medium sized block of clay, a little water, and this sketch. Here you go. The sketch is a little crude, but I am sure that it will suffice. Fire it with a quality firing sheet and give the resulting product to Gawfed. Jihli told me that he was eager to receive it.");
