However, a few things keep me going - my duty to keep the arena in order and the knowledge that I might still bring pain and suffering to Nevederia. I wish her to suffer as I did with the loss of a child. She may stay safe in the Temple of Veeshan but her brood does not. Slay her three children and bring me proof of their deaths so they may serve as my message to Nevederia. I will compensate you with a pair of gloves fit for a fine warlord if you can give me this satisfaction.");
