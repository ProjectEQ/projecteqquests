For example, I	copied down all those [armor patterns] and [cultural symbol patterns] that were displayed during that spring festival eleven years ago. You know the one where we had that competition to see who could make the best suit of armor! Boy, that was a great festival. The apple tarts were amazing.	I'm glad I wrote down the recipe for those too!");

I have all the designs written down and recorded somewhere in one of my journals; all I'll need is the materials for the pattern book itself. Just bring me a cat skull cap for the cover, a fractured femur for the spine, a minotaur horn for the clasp, and a bunch of optic nerves to grind down and make a salve, which will protect and preserve the finished product. I hear these items can be found in the Runnyeye Goblin territory and the Beholder's Maze, but I'm not really sure? Anyway, once I have those, I can make you a pattern book. Hey, then we can go fishing!");

The first is an adventure into [Beholder's	Maze] where you will clear a path for young Halflings so they can make a safe passage through the maze to East Karana. The next you will be tasked with venturing into the heart of [the Hole] where you hunt for some ingredients for my drip clock. The third task leads you into [Karnor's Castle] where you will collect bone specimen for my collection. The final task you will adventure into [Stillmoon temple] and	learn about the creatures that inhabit the area.");
