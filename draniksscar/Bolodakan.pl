They are perverting the craftsmanship and style of the dragorns that built that wondrous structure. If my [master] were still here he would have words for those beasts working on that accursed [beacon]. But, alas his time has passed and it is up to me to not only provide for my [family] and his, but to uphold the traditions of architecture and craftsmanship that are the heritage of all dragorn as well.");

It is an outrage that the Muramites have turned our glorious works to this. Mata Muram's forces, with every day of work, are defiling the memory of the great father Dranik. It is said that when he died, Dranik's head rested on the very spot where the tower stands. If only I could get a [sample] of their work, perhaps I could find a way to do something to slow or destroy it.");

Because of his great renown among the dragorn, he was taken to the Wall of Slaughter to aid in the renovations of what ruins were left there after the invasion. Since that day I have heard [rumors] that he was slain by one of the disgusting girplan he was forced to work with.");

When Ladislev was taken to the Wall of Slaughter he was forced to work in concert with these horrid things.

I heard that he argued with them so much that they decided the work would be easier without him and [killed him].");

However, if he is dead I shudder to think of his knowledge and tools in the possession of the Muramites. Perhaps you could venture there and investigate these rumors for me. Ladislev always wore a ring that proclaimed his status as a master architect. If you find that he is dead bring me that ring along with his [tools]. But if he is alive, do all that you can to free him and return with him.");

With the coming of the Muramites our house was ransacked and we were chased from the city by a pack of ukun. We were forced to leave at a moment's notice and only just avoided being eaten alive by those vile beasts. One of the items we had to leave was the great [crest] of my family.");
