Hmmmmm, Uncle mentions in his letter that he worked out a way for a gnome to make a giant set of crab crackers. He states it is useless in Norrath but I may be able to make some use of it out here. I guess it wouldn't hurt to share it with you and file it away in the library. To create the cracker combine two metal rods, firewater and a knuckle joint in a toolbox. Interesting indeed, anyways here if your reward; I hope you can put it to good use.");
