He was recently promoted to official courier of the brotherhood. He has most recently been tasked with the responsibility to take documents to and from Mistmoore. Most notably our battle strategies that are very dangerous if they end up in the wrong hands. I do not know what has become of him and I have grown worried. Would you be [willing to help me locate Gerod].");

Ah yes of course, he was to report to Eirod Haerod with our latest plans for the attack on Kelethin with the help of Clan Crushbone. If you wished to find his whereabouts visiting her would probably be a good place to start. Bring this symbol, so that she will know we have sent you.");

I sure hope you do not find them because if you do, he is surely dead. I hope to hear good news from you soon Vatglut. Please return to me should you find his medallions so I can bring the news to the brotherhood.");

There seems to be some kind of an encrypted message in these documents and it appears to be written by Gerod. I cannot make it out completely but I believe it says something about a Rok. Please take this to whomever you can to try and make some sense of Gerods scribbling. As always, if you find anything that might belong to Gerod please return it to me. I do know of one specific [keepsake] he carries.");
