#Fire Beetle Eyes/Mammoth Tusks (Kerran Fire Beetle Eyes)
#There is alot of confusion about the fire beetle eyes/kerran fire beetle eyes.
#It is my thought that people are mixing the two quests up, and imagining a
#third quest, when really there are just two.  It's not possible to turn
#in 5 items to a quest giver at once, the person who said 4 beetle eyes
#and 1 mammoth tusk was making it up.  I don't know why.  The turn ins
#are a combined box of fire beetle eyes (either sort of beetle eye works)
#for the first quest and 2 mammoth tusks (called bull elephant tusks in the
#dialog, but a well known never fixed screw up on VI's part) for the second.
#I did this quest on live numerous times, though it has been years.  It was
#excellent xp for a new character. -Kilelen
