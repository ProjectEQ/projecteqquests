Why don't you go talk to that banker and give it to him? There's been nothing but trouble since you all arrived. I'm sick and tired of you people traipsing through here like you own the place. Before you know it, this place will be a smelly den of inequity like Qeynos. I'd like to take that Banker Mardalson and all the rest and feed them to the [" .. eq.say_link("river") .. "]!");

Legend has it that long ago the Unkempt asked their queen to prevent intruders from crossing the river and entering the Unkempt Woods. The Queen agreed and now to this day everyone that gets close to the river is seldom heard from again. Why don't you go take a look already and leave me alone!?");

Nobody reads this language anymore, but I think I understand the basics. You will need some high quality loam and some magic earth. Marshes are a good place to find loam. Magical soil might be a problem, but certainly you can find some that will work. These two items are used to create the cleansing loam. It's the third item that I don't like.");

The ritual seems to say that you must take the seed and insert it into the heart of a noble creature to give it strength, then rest that in the loam and earth. I don't like the idea of killing anything noble for such a ritual. I'm not sure what I think of this whole thing now. I'll leave that up to you. Here is a pot that you can use for the ritual. If you still want to do this and you find a heart that might work, bring it to me and I'll see if I can help.");

I'm not sure how well it will work with the seed ritual, I'm certain that the original intent was to rip the heart from an honorable foe.  Here, take this bowl.  You'll need to go back to the Plane of Storms and find some pure rain water to cleanse the heart.  Pouring the water over the heart while in the bowl should purify it, though it might also destroy the bowl.  Never mind that, though.  If it works you should be able to use the heart for the ritual.
