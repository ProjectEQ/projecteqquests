If you seek page 34, you will first have to find Moodoro. I had page 30 for but a few days when a man swiped it from the library's shelves. I believe he wore the garb of a guard of Qeynos. He darted away so fast I did not have time to cast a single spell! I believe he is still in Highpass, I can feel it!!");
