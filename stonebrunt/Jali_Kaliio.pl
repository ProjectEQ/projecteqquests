   quest::say("That is my wife, Yuio. She has come down with a sickness, no doubt caused by those accursed kobolds.");
   quest::me("Anger wracks Jali's face as he speaks.");
   quest::say("I would ask you for [help] but you are a stranger and owe us nothing. Of course if you did assist me, I would be forever greatful.");

   quest::say("Khonza Ayssla is the village's High Shaman. She teaches the ancient ways of Okanjo and is most wise. If she cannot assist you I do not know who can. I would go myself but I am too worried to leave my dear wife behind. When you find Khonza, tell her that Jali sent you. Please hurry, friend!");

   quest::say("She needs much rest. I cannot begin to thank you enough for helping us. Please accept this as a reward. It is not much but it should be of some use. You are indeed a friend of ours and if you ever need shelter from the wilds, please visit us again.");
