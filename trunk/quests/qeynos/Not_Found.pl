They packed and left their respective cities and set out to find their companions.  One by one, they joined together until all were united once again.  Many tales were told and memories revisited.

Their knowledge of Norrath was put to the test against the many others of differing faiths.  Soon, the fellowship realized the completion of their challenge.  They had triumphed against the odds yet again, succeeding where many others had failed.  Their reward was very simple.  The ancient being pulled from thin air, a silver, glowing scroll.  This scroll was entrusted to few, but I myself have a copy.  Do you care to hear me read it aloud?"); }
