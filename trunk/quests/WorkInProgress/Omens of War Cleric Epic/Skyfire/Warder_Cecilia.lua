This seal, when fused with a Swirling Pearl inside Zordak's heart should allow our seers to divine his true intentions, even after he has been slain. Once you have the seal I will release Zordak, make haste I will not be able to hold him for long.");

Fennin Ro's voice is silent to them now. The remainder of their power faded with the Pantheon's interest in mortal affairs. In their mad pursuit of power, they have allied themselves with Mata Muram. They plan on trading their home-world for the promise of power. Even now their leader is within the Muramite Trials. Trying to earn a position of rank within the Legion. Stop him, once he completes the trials we may lose our opportunity to stop him. I am afraid you will have to visit the Labrynth's trials and stop him before he is able to complete them. Best of luck to you.");
