They are [Qinimi], [Riwwi], [Barindu], and [Ferubi]. Based off of early information, we believe each area had a specific purpose. I am still trying to decipher the native language to figure out what the names mean, but going off of visual information I can assume that Qinimi served as their court, Riwwi is where they held games, Barindu was a lush garden, and Ferubi was a central place of worship once. That is about the extent of my information as far as the intended purpose of each area. What they are now used for I can explain in further detail. Which area would you like to hear more about?");

Destroying many of the native symbols, the invaders have converted the building that once served as the court into fortified headquarters. It is here you will find a structure called the Chamber of Souls, various pens to hold ukun, and a moat of sickly black sludge. The structures that the nihil once called home are all but destroyed now. Very sad indeed. That's where the legion keeps the bulk of the [slaves]. I believe that the scout for this area was caught sneaking around the housing district, but I have no proof. If you were to search this area, maybe you would find some sort of sign or marker he may have left. That would be helpful.");

Due to their fragile bodies, they cannot do any heavy lifting, but their knowledge of shaping stone makes them perfect for building new structures for the legion to use as well as altering current ones. They command the stone workers. I am not sure how the slaves are used in the temple areas. That information is held by L`diava.");

It seems that just before he was captured he was trying to communicate with the slaves in the area. The text is very hard to make out, but it looks like he may have been trying to get into the main headquarters. He was interacting with a particular slave named Sislono Nislan. This slave promised him a way into the headquarters only if he promised to rid the area of a tyrant, named Tixxrt. The rest of the parchment is undecipherable. I would suggest finding this slave and showing him this to see if he knows what happened.");

While I cannot make out most of it, Kreshin has translated some of it and it appears to be a description of a ritual one of the head ikaav performs regularly. Apparently she has been trying to absorb the geomantic powers of the natives of Taelosia. The details are kind of sketchy as Kreshin was only able to translate so much, but some information is better than none, I always say. Anyway, it says here that the ritual is conducted in the Chamber of Souls. It used to be a large tower which the natives used to watch the shores. The tower was destroyed when the invaders took over the area and converted it to a ritual chamber. They used it in experiments centered on the extraction of magic. The head ikaav, known as Xictic, has been trying to use the powers of the native Taelosians to build an army of stone workers that he can directly control instead of relying on the ability of slaves. During the ritual, Xictic stands atop a platform which is suspended over a circle of platforms. The center platform holds an inanimate stone worker while eight ikaav stand on smaller platforms around the center. What happens next is not really known, but the end result is three lifeless slave corpses. According to this, she has not yet been successful, which I would say is good news. But if we do not stop her, she could easily reinforce the numbers with stone workers tainted by the touch of this legion. I know you have accomplished your goal, but I must ask that you find a way into this ritual and silence Xictic for good. Show this to Nislan. He should be able to decipher the images. I believe this is the key to getting into the ritual chamber. Now, hurry please and return to me with proof of Xictic's death so that I can make a final report on the Qinimi area to Fezbin.");
