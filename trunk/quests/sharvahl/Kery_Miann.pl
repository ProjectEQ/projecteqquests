His exploration of the lands that surround our home made it possible for us to live here in peace. This leads us to our next lesson. I would like you to seek out the caverns beyond the thicket. A breed of shelled creatures roam the tunnels of those caverns. Occasionally, a strong glow will manifest itself in one of these creatures. Find such a creature and bring me the source of its glow. Wrap the light source in your Khati Sha recruit's cloak and place them both in this box.");
