I have lived a long and fruitful life, yet I yearn for the past and a time when some of us were still whelps, where we learned everything we knew from our masters. My mentor was of the first brood, an ancient dragon, older than any of the other dragons save Veeshan herself. She was and still is a very powerful dragon and I yearn to speak with her. Her name is Lendiniara the Keeper and was the best teacher any dragon could ever have. How would you like to connect me with her great mind? You could perhaps [deliver] a message for me, since I cannot travel these days.");
