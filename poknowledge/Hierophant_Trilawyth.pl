The adepts of the city have come together collectively and as individuals in hopes of aiding our visitors as we are able. In my time upon Norrath, I served as a child of nature dedicated to Tunare, the Mother of All. Though my faith has not wavered and my philosophies of nature have only grown in this astral city, I am able to train any druid who is in need of gaining a better grasp upon their skills. Mind you, however, that I am not a preacher and will not guide you through the instruction of faith or spell, for it is these things you must acquire and perfect through your own trials.'");
