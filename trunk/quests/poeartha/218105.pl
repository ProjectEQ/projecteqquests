#
# To use this template all one must do is change anywhere it says:
# NPC ID NUMBER HERE -- The corresponding NPC ID from the PEQ database.
# NPC NAME GOES HERE -- The appropriate NPC's name. This name is commented out
#                   but is extremely useful to someone who may come along
#                       down the road and be looking at the code.
