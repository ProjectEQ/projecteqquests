We Storm Reapers believe that the walls once surrounded beautiful and fruitful gardens. The arrogance of the caretaker of the gardens offended the Gods and in turn the gardens were cursed with disease and an evil power that animates the corpses of the dead. The Scarecrow, Old Gourdhead, stands in one of these two fields and warns passers by that it is an accursed place. Recently someone has been placing rats in the fields to become diseased.");
