Such a work is heresy and would be destroyed if the High Council knew of its existence so I have been tight-lipped about my discovery.  If you would like to see it. I will show it to you. for a nominal donation of 20 gold pieces."); }

It would seem to be part of a larger body of work, but this page describes a Teir'Dal who it seems was instrumental in creating the head of the very first scarecrow. You may keep that as it is merely a magical duplicate of the original document which I have carefully hidden.");

In fact, there are deep claw marks on the bindings and surface of the tome. It looks like the current owner didn't care well for it. Hmm. . . This translation of it may be spotty, but I think I'll be able to convey the general meaning for you. Ah, here you are. A duplicate copy of the writings. I'll hold on to the original as it won't be of much use to you. Many thanks, $name!");
