I came here a long time go, searchin' for treasures and [information] the likes of which I never thought possible. I tried to get a couple of my [old friends] along too, but they thought it was goin' to be too dangerous. I guess they were right, and I shouldn't have ever come here, but I did.'");}

They chose four of the most strongest an' had them keep him under wraps so he wouldn't get loose an' go on a killing spree again. Anyway, I caught wind of this and decided that this was the greatest achievement a gnome like meself could ever make, and I began a [trek] for it.'");}

They tried to tell me that there were bad things brewin' down here, and that any attempt to find or somehow wake that dragon up was a bad idea. It turned out they were right.

I walked up to it and looked over it, and what did my eyes spy, but an inscription telling the way to this very tomb! I knew that I would have to keep going, despite my tired legs, my hungry belly, and my aching body. When I finally found the entrance to the tomb, I couldn't believe [what I saw].'");}
