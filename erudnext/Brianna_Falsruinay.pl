She often travels once or twice a month to deliver and pick up her most recent workings. However, she still has not returned from her most recent [travel]. We fear the worst for her; pirates have been rampant around these parts lately. We should send [someone to Qeynos] soon but have not had the time to do so.");

I believe the person she used to exchange magic with was named Jalorin. He is a member of the Order of Three so you should be able to find him there. Present him with this medal so that he may know you are sent from us. Please return to me if you should discover anything about Elisi's disappearance.");

This map appears to have some dull writing on it but I cannot make it out correctly. While you were gone, my husband reminded me that Elisi always wore her medallion given to her by her mother and her guards carried the finest blade ever presented to a Sentinel of Erudin. If you could find 3 of these guardian blades along with Elisi's medallion I believe that we could come to a conclusion on Elisi's whereabouts. The sad news is that if you should recover these items there is no doubt in my mind that she is dead because she would never give up her medallion willingly. Oh and here is the map you took from Jalorin, I have no use for it.");
