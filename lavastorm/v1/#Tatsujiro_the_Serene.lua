It is very old, that's for sure.  This is ancient Sebilisian cloth.  I don't know of anyone that makes cloth this way these days.  I can't imagine that this was made by any of the natives of the Broodlands.  The only place this could have come from would be a tomb or ruin in Kunark.  We'll certainly have to take a closer look at this, but my first guess is that it belongs to someone that to travel a lot and robs tombs as a hobby.  Hopefully further examination will tell us who this belonged to.  Thank you very much for bringing this to me.'")

Well, that's interesting.  Whew, if only it didn't smell so foul!  Hang on, let me take a look at this.  I know a little about eggs, though not much about dragon eggs.  I can tell you that this egg was most certainly healthy when it was laid.  You can see that the embryo was just about fully formed before something horrible happened to it.  Whew, that smell!  If I had to guess, I'd say that this egg was no more than a few years from hatching before this happened.  And this happened recently, I can still sense the dark magic that ruined this life.  Thank you for bringing this to us.  I'll pass it on to a more skilled researcher, but first I think I'll find something waterproof to put it in, maybe that will stifle the stink.'")

As deformed as this poor beast was, most of its major organs and structures are relatively normal.  I can only guess, but I'd say that whatever happened to this drake it was not a defect of birth.  It was some sort of curse or plague that caused this damage, and it did so recently.  Whatever happened down there, it had the power to warp this magnificent creature.  The pain it suffered must have been devastating.  If they think that we caused this then I can understand why they hate us so much.  Thank you for bringing this to me.'")

I can feel the electricity that once coursed through it.  It is obviously an artifact of the Broodlands and very old.  I can only guess what it might have looked like when whole.  Judging by the outer curvature I'd say that it might have been as large as twenty feet across, if it was indeed a disk-shaped object.  I can sense that the magic this object held was defensive in nature, some sort of warding or protective barrier.  If that's true, then it must have been huge!

This dragon scale is very unusual.  It appears to be in a state of flux, somewhere between shadow and reality. It carries a sort of static charge as well.  It appears to be a scale from the storm dragon, Yar`Lir.  That may be what it is, but it seems a little too large to be from her.  Another storm dragon perhaps?  I can't explain why it is partially in shadow, but it looks like an effect of the undead to me.  Hopefully one of our researchers can discover more.  Thank you so much for bringing this to us.'")
