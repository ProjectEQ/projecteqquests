At least you have the heart to fight back against those worthless thieves. If it were up to my kinsmen we'd all just roll over and thank them for ruining our world. After the battles you've been through I wonder if you could take care of a few [things] for me.");

I've noticed [three] of the Muramites in particular who seem to have a bit more sway in the legion than a common soldier. Perhaps if you could see that these Muramites had a bit of an accident, the rest of the dragorn would come to their senses and see that the Muramites are nothing more than a pathetic band of slavers.");

I wouldn't put anything past him and would prefer it if I didn't have to cross his path again.");

As reluctant as they may be to rise against the oppression, no one deserves that sort of treatment. Bring me Guttertusk's helm and the hides from three of his fellow noc and you shall have stories told of your deeds for all time.");

She likes to dominate those around her with her charm and trance spells. I would hate to fall under her spell even for a moment. If you could kill her for me and bring me her magical amulet and a scrap of skin from three of her fellow ikaav it would be a boon to the dragorn of the city.");
