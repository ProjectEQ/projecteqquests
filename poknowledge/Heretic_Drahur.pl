    quest::say("Salutations. The keepers of necromancy in New Tanaan are neither your enemy or foe, as they may have been upon the material world of Norrath. Though our natures are in tact, we have elevated ourselves beyond the petty, debased bickering that Norrath has come to embody over the passing eras. All adventurers and intelligent beings are welcome in our midst, for we share only the common goal of knowledge and personal betterment in our power. I have gathered tomes and spells that I no longer have use for, as I have ascended beyond Norrath's limitations of the dark arts. However, you remain a mortal still and your abilities may never reach the esteemed levels of ours, bur do not let this discourage you. Search my tomes and perhaps I hold something of importance or relevance to your current quest for power. There is another realm of magic that I am quite familiar with, as well -- the aspects of planar magic.");
