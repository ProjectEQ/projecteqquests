#Description: The point of this quest is to locate the child. Sadly, she has been eaten by a viscious (or is that viscous?) gel cube from the Qeynos Sewers.
#You randomly find the remains of her bloodied dress on Cuburt. This was a boon to low level int casters as the reward was randomly (I recall one in 5 ish) a +3 int earring.
#Personal note: EQEmu spawn/drop rate on the dress from Cuburt is awful, compared to live, so I have upped the "good" reward to 35% chance.
#Other NPCs that you can hand the dress into: Guard Elron, North Qeynos; Endric, South Qeynos
