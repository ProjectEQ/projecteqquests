Not some silly thing to make the girl of your dreams fall in love mind you- this fabled tonic was intended to be shared only between two who had found true love. If their feelings were strong enough it would... well, that was part of the problem, no one knew what it was supposed to do. Kanaad learned of some crazy human in the mountains that had supposedly figured out the secret to the potion. The results were not what anyone had hoped for.");

Kanaad had a time getting the ingredients and was only to make just a very little bit. He sat down with his love, alone in a room and intended to share the elixir. Well, that was the last anyone saw of her, and he was manic, out of his mind... The mixture had driven him from his senses and he snapped. It took quite a bit to restrain him and figure out what to do next.");

All that we could do was give him a controlled intake of the potion for his addiction and try to treat his dementia. With his returning sanity came the realization of what he had done to his love. It was the most harrowing thing I have ever seen someone go through in all of my life... He is better now, but has never quite been the same and rarely speaks to strangers. Give him this and you should at least get a chance to explain.");
