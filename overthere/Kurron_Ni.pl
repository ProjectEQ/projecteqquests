Now I ask you, worthy shadowknight, do you not feel the fires of hatred coursing through your veins like never before? That is the very reward I spoke of! You have been brought closer to my master.

Return this to me and I shall share with you my dark mission, and the immeasurable reward that will be earned at its completion. Show your face here without fulfilling my request and I will offer you on the altar to Innoruuk himself. Be off!");
