I had no choice but to get rid of it.  I carefully jumped onto its back.  I had to be careful, that thing is full of dagger-length spikes!  Once on, I rode that thing for hours until it got worn out and started back to the beach.  I suppose I coulda killed it and brought it back, but I was a might tired, and decided that it would be too heavy to try to get onto the boat and let it go.  Besides, it mighta been a momma turtle.");

Have you ever been ice fishing?  I didn't think so.  I have, but only once.  I was traveling alone in the northlands with my favorite dog, my best rod and an axe.  I settled in, cut the hole I needed, and started writin' limericks in my head to pass the time.  It was so cold that I had to keep clearin' the hole every ten minutes!  It wasn't but an hour later when I felt a bite and gave the line a tug.  The line tugged back so hard that I slipped on the ice and went right into the hole!  Whatever had me pulled me straight down.'");

It was getting' darker, so I was only a few feet behind the fish when I could see that it was a twenty-foot swordfish!  It was swimming hard for the bottom for a few minutes when it suddenly stopped.  I could see below it that there was something glowin' down there.  They looked like lights in the windows of Freeport when you come home off the sea in a heavy fog.  I could swear that I even saw people walkin' in the streets down there, ghostly lookin' folk.  Well, the fish was scared an' turned to swim away.  So I grabbed it by the gills and pulled with all my might.  I got one hand on either side of it, both holdin' on to its gills, and I rode that monster straight up to the surface.  There was no hole left!  Well, I had to break off that fish's nose with my bare hands to cut my way out.  I sorta felt sorry for that fish, havin' ta deal with the other swordfish without his sword from that day on.");
