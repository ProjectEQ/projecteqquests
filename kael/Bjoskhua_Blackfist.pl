Rumors abound that even near the waters of velious they had great cities. All at once they seemed to be wiped from the face of Norrath. One of the travelers I recently spoke to informed me that a single Kedge may still live in the lands of Faydwer. As grotesque as it sounds, the backbone of a Kedge may be used to create indestructible scroll cases. Bring me the backbone of this fishman, if he exists, and you will find yourself a richer person.");
