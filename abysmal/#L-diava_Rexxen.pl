We do not know who this god is, but we believe he is a false god centered around a belief in natural destruction. Xounii Resnen was the scout assigned to this area. She was given this task because of her expertise in shapeshifting. I told her to take the shape of a trusik native and interact with them to find out more information. She managed to fit in quite well. Perhaps too well. Gradually, reports came less frequently until they eventually stopped. While everyone feared she had suffered the same fate as the other scouts, I think she started to believe she was really a trusik and has abandoned her assignment. What I need you to do is go there and find her. Now, be careful, the trusik are not a friendly race of beings and they are even more irritated by the invasion of the Muramite army. When you find Xounii I fear she may attack you. If this happens, I will not fault you for defending yourself, but if it comes to this I want some form of proof as to what happened.");

Due to the sheer size of this area, we sent a scouting force there to investigate. All of them are still alive, save one, named Kitren Lanom. None of the scouts left in the area know what happened to her or her belongings. Last time they remember seeing her was when she entered the Temple of Tri-Fates in an attempt to pass the temple trial. Please go to Kod'Taz and speak to Kevren Nalavat. He should be able to help you access the three trials. You will have to enter each trial and bring me back anything you find of Kitren's from each temple. Even though the scouts there have searched many times for something, I think a fresh set of eyes may help some. Kevren is the only one who knows you are helping me. Please do not let the others know you were sent by me. I have not yet ruled out the possibility of foul play and if they are aware of your affiliation, it may place you in more danger.");

This does not bode well for anyone. We must find out more about this. I must ask that you return to Yxtta and see if you can find any more of Xounii's entries. I cannot tell you where to start looking, but it seems that the best place to look would be in the caves where you found her. Xounii was very diligent about her reports so she would have written much about this. Try to find four more pieces of her journal entries and return them to me.");
