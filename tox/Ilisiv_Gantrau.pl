The triangle begins to glow and the power within the orb erupts in a brilliant display of color and immediately infuses the triangle with its power. Ilisiv makes a final gesture over the triangle and a brief swirl of luminescent light encompasses her. A new orb appears on the ground in the center of the triangle. Ilisiv holds her hand over the triangle and after a moment, all is calm again. The glowing light of the triangle fades.");
