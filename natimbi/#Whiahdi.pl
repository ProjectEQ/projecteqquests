It appears that the paladin wielding the staff has been killed and the staff returned to its master. The staff's master has broken the staff into three pieces. two of the pieces have been given to his most trusted minions, and the third piece, a globe of discordant energy, resides in a location known as Anguish, in the Realm of Discord. If you wish to somehow rebuild the staff you must find these three pieces. I can still hear the staff begging for its master. The staff tells me the only way the minions will appear is if a certain phrase is uttered at a place where the power of discord seeks to engulf all. The phrase is, 'Sanait Sanaiij Tsulum'. I don't know what it means or where this place of great discord is however. I'm sorry that's all the staff has told me. If you find all three staff pieces, return them to me along with Soulwhisper and I will see if I can reform the staff for you.");

If you can get my earthly possessions back, I will help you in regards to the location of the paladin. Find my brother, Taiandao in Barindu.
