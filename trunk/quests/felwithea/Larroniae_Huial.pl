The Wayfarers Brotherhood will ask you to answer some questions when you first meet with them. They tend to call all of their assignments 'adventures.' You'd do well to keep that in mind as they'll be more likely to give you some tasks. There is other information that makes them easier to [deal with] too.");

Some members will tell you stories, if they think you are worthy of learning such prized information. Others will share their treasures with you, but only if you do work for them.");

With the points of Favor that their record keepers have counted for you, you can trade your good Favor for wonderful treasures and goods. Also, the more adventures you do for the Wayfarers Brotherhood, the more your Favor increases. The harder jobs get you more Favor, by the way. As you gain more Favor, the Wayfarers Brotherhood treasure keepers will let you peek at some of their more unique and sought after items. So, it pays to get in good with them, you see! And there's [more]!");

At first we just thought they were simple things -- rocks, pebbles, gems, and the like -- and then we noticed they had very unusual auras about them. Well, one day, Morden Rasp was toying with one -- a shiny green shard -- and he went to scrape it with his dagger. Suddenly, the shard began to reform and fused with his dagger. While the dagger remained as fine as ever, Morden himself felt a surge of strength! So, you will want to watch out for these strange magic pieces in the world. Now, I suggest you go talk to Selephra Giztral, Barstre Songweaver, Vual Stoutest, Teria Grinntli, or Ruanya Windleaf. They handle all of those who are interested in working for the Wayfarers Brotherhood and getting rewards. Remember well what I've told you!");
