Cabilis would like to study the weapons and learn this technique so we can better outfit our troopers. If you will bring me four of the same weapon I will spread your name through our city, and one day you may be able to walk the streets. I am looking for Steel Ch'Ror, Mak'Stor, So'Shar, Ta'Nak, Ga'Nak, and Re'Stek. Until then I will reward you with whatever coin I can get from turning them in for you.");

It was built near a small freshwater spring with legendary restorative properties, this small outpost was considered one of the finest treasures of the realm. Highly-ranked Iksar from the empire came here to cure their illness and extend their lives with the mystical [waters]. This town was originally created by the Kylong tribe of Iksar, but was assimilated into the ranks of Venril Sathir when he united the five tribes. Many [legendary Iksar] lived there.");

These three Kylong were [Verix Kylox], [Dakon Sythrax], and [Sirk Vemat]. As they fled from their tribe they knew that the chances to form the medallion together would be less if the Kylong split up. Verix attempted to hide in the hills of the Dreadlands. Dakon headed north to the Field of Bone. Sirk Vemat headed to the Burning Woods to hide in the forest.");

He hid the amulet and some of his more powerful tomes here. One of which was a great [book of necromancy]. The possessor of the book could have full control over an army of undead. He left the skeletons to do his work and returned to surrender to the Kunzar's forces. He was sent to Veksar to work through his days studying the effects of the spring.");

The skeletons milled around in disarray. After finding the book and reading what of it he could he found that the skeletons would do his bidding. I have heard rumors that Sythrax was able to assume the form of a great lich to live through the decades. His hatred for being trapped, and for being forced to work for Venril has built over the ages. He only wants to escape this place so he can retrieve his medallion and books that he believes to be in the Field of Bone.");

He dug a hole as deep into the mountain as he could and placed it in the hole and covered it over. I have heard tales that a slaving rat by the name of Niblek would find the necklace. Niblek's love for shiny things meant that he would keep it with him, but would offer it as trade to anyone that had his favorite type of gems.");

Even Iksar commoners came here desperate to cure whatever ailed them. Since the war with the dragons was always escalating, a massive dome was built overhead to keep the attacks of the dragons away.

This would not only trap them, but also dilute the waters, preventing any further healing from taking place. [Garudon] would lead in the direct attack of the town.");

Garudon was caught in a snare set up by the town's defense. Crumbling to the ground the dome sealed their fate. Garudon fought with the Iksar from under the dome with no hope of escaping. The Dragons then called upon the waters to flow, and flood the valley. The spring was flooded, its magical properties lost forever. The soldiers finally brought down Garudon. With his last breath he let out a flame that scorched much of the dome and then fell from the air, crashing through the ceiling of the theater that was built to entertain the Iksar on the mend. Most of his [bones] still remain there, while others were ground up in necromantic ceremonies.");

Because a constant surge of necromancy was needed to keep the citizens of Veksar animated it could not be stopped. They would have to find a way to prevent the magic from flowing into the theater and reanimating Garudon himself. The mystic words painted onto the wall of the theater seem to point to the fact that the flow of necromancy into the theater is stifled. This is all the lore of the town of Veksar that I can recall.");
