I wonder what ever became of him. Oh yes, now I remember, he went Batty! Stark raving mad!' He begins to poke Katarin hard in the head presumably to accentuate his friend's madness.

Since he's not at home right now and there's no lute then I guess you'll just have to stay insane! Luckily for you I'm here to keep us all alive though! Come, help me catch a snipe for dinner, I hear they are good eating! You just have to take your helmet off, and bang the back end of it with your hand and they'll fly right in!");

A soft aria fills the stale air of the cavern with a strange warmth. Something inside you awakens that you had long forgotten. So long forgotten that you are unable to conjure a name for it from your memory. As the song ends the strange feeling leaves you as the darkness of the cavern closes in once more around you.");

Here, take this note to my son Jusean in Qeynos. He'll be able to transcribe a proper song for you from it. I must stay here and attempt to save the other miners from the dark insanity of the mines.");
