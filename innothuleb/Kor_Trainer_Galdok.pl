The second item would be the scale of a Mermaid, which would be found in the Ocean of Tears, though I highly doubt it will come easily. The third, and final item, admittedly, is not a component for the belt, but rather a task of a more [personal nature]. This item would be a Minotaur's Battle Axe, which can be found in several areas of Norrath, including the Gorge of the great King Xorbb. Return to me with these, and I shall craft
for you a belt of fine quality.");
