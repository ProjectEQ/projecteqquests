However, duty would sometimes deem that she trek beyond the forests to assure its protection. In the peak years of her life, she spent much time wandering the whole of Norrath in pursuit of one villain that had betrayed the entire order. We are not certain why or how this one, who at one time was Nyrein's most trusted of companions and second to only her within the order, fell to the temptations and corruption of The Faceless -- but we do know that Nyrein defeated him on the battlefield. He fled to the Plane of Fear and with him went the very essence of the Tempest Guard that remains caged within his corrupted, violent spirit. Find the Tempest Reaver and retrieve the Essence of the Tempest Guard, which you must then seal within the Hollowed Tempest Stone to create the Tempest's Guard Stone. Once you have this sacred stone, return it to Lady Deira.");

Aaaah, but enough reminiscing for one day -- your trial is the matter at hand. Within the Hollowed Tempest Stone you must combine the Essence of the Tempest Guard, which you will find only through great peril.
