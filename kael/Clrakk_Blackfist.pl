There is a particular Coldain whose death will strike fear into the hearts of many. His name is Deaen Greyforge, a Coldain knight. He is both feared and respected by his kind. If you can destroy him, it will send a message to the Coldain that they are not safe from the wrath of the giants. Kill him and chop his body into bits. Bring me a few pieces as proof that the fool is dead.");
