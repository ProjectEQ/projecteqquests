Let me look at it, maybe you're not completely wasting my time.  Well, it's old.  I haven't seen anything like this since I did some adventuring in Kunark.  This is the sort of stuff we used to pull out of old tombs, ceremonial garb and junk like that.  Not worth anything at all these days.  Looks like it's the color of royal robes or something.  Ok, this is interesting enough, you've earned your reward.  Maybe we can find an Erudite scholar of some sort to find out who owned the robe this came from.'")

This dragon couldn't have been more than a few years from being born.  It looks as though some form of darkness was laid on this egg a very short while ago.

This thing was once a perfectly healthy drake and someone managed to twist it into this form.  The power required to do this would be awesome.  I can still feel the power coming from the corpse.

It must have been very large, but then dragons tend to do things big.  It's definitely made by the dragons in the Broodlands, but it's hard to tell what it was for.

I can tell immediately that this scale is in transit from a living state to an undead state.  I am reminded of a tale I heard once of a necromancer that spent his lifetime trying to become immortal by turning his flesh into that of the undead.  The ritual used was time-consuming and difficult, but when he finally chanted the last verse and the power of the unliving was upon him, it became clear to him exactly what his new immortal life would be like.  It frightened him.  He resisted the magic that he had woven upon himself.  They say that he might still exist someplace between the world of shadow and light, fighting to die like a mortal rather than live like the undead.  A story meant to frighten young students of the necromantic arts, for sure, but I believe there is some truth to the tale.  I shall examine this scale more closely.  Your efforts for our cause are appreciated.'")
