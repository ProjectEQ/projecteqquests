I find I can easily hold posts in place with my tail while I work with my hands and feet. An advantage I suppose. I would guess that's why I was asked to help Morden. Now, I'm working on creating some very strong glue we will use to seal parts of the hull of the ship we're building. Thing is, I need a lot of cove frog eyes for this job. If you want to [aid] me, I could reward you and give you some information.");

quest::say("Great, I'm working my way through a batch of glue. I keep it hidden so no one is tempted to steal it or play a practical joke on our friends. Here is your reward. I'll also tell you that I used to be a common thief, but not in the way you think. I had to steal a few supplies now and then when I lived on the lands as an exile. But then Morden Rasp found me and I haven't stolen a thing since.");
