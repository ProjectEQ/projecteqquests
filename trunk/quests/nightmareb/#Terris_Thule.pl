#Quest file for Lair of Terris Thule - Terris Thule: Planar Progression

#Terris Thule will spawn 15 x a dream defiler at 75% health, cast Direption of Dreams at 50% health, and spawn 4 x a grotesque statue at 35% health. Upon death a Planar Projection will spawn to give flags. The timer is used to continuously check to make sure that she is not pulled from her lair. If so, she will shout a curse and despawn.
