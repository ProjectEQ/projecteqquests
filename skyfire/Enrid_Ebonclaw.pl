Those wyverns have kept me asleep and were trying to turn me to ash. Since you are here, I will finish what I started.

They changed it because of greedy adventurers like you! As a servant to the Ring of Scale, I learned how to create a cipher to enter the peak -- one that overcomes the new ward that was erected. This cipher requires the original key or the essence of the original key. The original key was very magical and powerful, for it encompassed the strength of this continent. If you have the original key, you will need to modify it by combining it with this powerless cipher and the blood of a brood dragon. If you do not have the original key, however, you will need to capture the strength of this continent, the essence of the original key. [continue]");
