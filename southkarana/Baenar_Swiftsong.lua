A name that Quellious herself saw fit not to let anyone see, for a cleric loyal to her called the lands home. Open to all, the Fier'Dal, Koada'Dal and even the occasional [gnome].");

From his dwarven homelands he now will flee. Upon this place of tranquility he stumbled upon. He tortured and killed the cleric and his kin by morning's dawn. Within the sacred chapel walls the bloodshed took place. Eyes wild with rage, madness and blood upon his [face].");

Garanel was struck down, his soul cursed forever more, to haunt the grounds of the defiled estate, guarding its bloody floor. Undead monsters, ghosts and [ghouls] slaughter all those who stray. They say his undead power grows within him to this day. This sad tale, my friends, is the Legend of Unrest.");

Only the essences of those unjustly wronged or the vilest of souls are bound to this realm and sometimes end up in that accursed place.  Only that which binds them to this realm may set them free.   Curse those who would harm an innocent child!  I knew of one such unfortunate child.  I was to bring her a [doll] for her birthday but she fell to a thieving cutthroat's sword!'

I should let her memory go but I would stop my heart from beating before I forget that child. Here, take this invoice. I have no further use for it. Give it to Marfen Binkdirple.");

A song perhaps? To immortalize your heroic deeds in song? How about an epic battle with a gnoll pup? I'll make you famous.");

Unfortunately her parents forbade her from marrying a lowly bard such as myself. Her father married her off to a young merchant in Qeynos named Maligar. She married him only out of respect to her father. Her heart was truly mine, at least, so she always said. When Serra was born, I visited them both often. She was like no other, so innocent and sweet. In those few years I watched her grow up to be more and more like her mother and I saw none of the father in her appearance. I do not like Maligar, but the least we can do is inform him of his child's death. I saw his caravan pass by not more than a day ago headed to Qeynos.");

I curse him to stay upon the realm and deny him what he most desires! This is too much! I cannot play or write this day. The sadness overwhelms me. In honor of Serra, the daughter that was denied to me in spirit, I vow never to play this instrument again! It was her favorite and she listened to me play for hours on end. Here take it! Take it out of my sight! Leave me be with my grief and my loss.");
