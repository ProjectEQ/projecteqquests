I have a series of tests that will require you to test both your hunting and navigational skills. These tests will not leave you with nothing to show for your work, because upon completing them you will be outfitted with a full suit of Initiate Watchman's armor. Are you [ready to be tested]?");

First, I will present you with this Watchman's Mail Assembly kit to gather assorted items from both your training grounds of the Steamfont Mountains and in our great town of Ak'anon. You will then combine the different recipes of components in your kit to create a material that will be used with a mold in a forge to create your Watchman armor. When you are ready to craft a specific piece, all you must do is tell me what armor piece you want to craft, and I will present you with the recipe for the material, along with the mold. I have the material recipes necessary to make Initiate Watchman [Helms], [Bracers], [Armguards], [Boots], [Greaves], [Gauntlets] and [Breastplates].");
