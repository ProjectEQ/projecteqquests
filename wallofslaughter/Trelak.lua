Perhaps we can aid each other? I am an armor smith that has crafted many fine pieces for the more prestigious officers in the dragorn militia.

If you help me, I will craft superior pieces of plate armor fit for our mightiest fighters for you.

I was so busy with taking all of my tools that I did not have time to stock myself with enough sustenance to see me through this ordeal. From time to time I have seen kvy archers eating from a small food sack. I think if you bring me two of these sacks I can continue my work for quite awhile. Your main task though will be to bring me a certain piece of metal I have long had my eye on. There was a certain dragorn elder by the named of Patorav, a wiser and kinder noble did not exist. Wherever he went, he always carried with him a fine [walking stick].");

I secretly returned only to watch the Muramites destroy my shop and steal what was left. I saw the leader of this pack of dark thieves place my tongs in an embossed leather sack . . . Which was probably stolen as well. I want you to bring me this sack so I may retrieve my tongs and perhaps other possessions he stole from me. I also want you to repay those brutes for wrecking my shop and home. Bring me back two noc right hands so I know they will no longer steal from me or my people ever again.");

Many times we come across objects that are highly magical in nature and often we are able to capture this mystical essence and reuse it for our own purposes. The riftseekers have something I very much want. It was these very same beings that betrayed my people to the Muramites, but that is not important now. I know that the riftseeker's heart is not akin to a heart that beats within you or me. It is magical. Find and bring me one of those hearts. Your must also bring me two large pieces of Kuuan Ore as my stock is running a bit low. Return with these and I will make you a bracer much like the ones dragorn warriors wear into battle.");

Enemies would routinely pause momentarily when he strode upon the field. After the portal exploded though, no trace of Makyah was found. I am more interested in his axe though, which may yet hold salvation for my people. It is my hope that the enchantments and techniques used to create the axe might be used for other purposes. Find and return Makyah's axe to me so I may use it to help my people. To remove the enchantments properly though, I will also need two yearning crystals. With the proper ceremony, gems such as these can be used to transfer charms from one object to another. Come back when you have recovered these and I will give you a pair of gloves that I was crafting in honor of a dragorn elder.");

He and I went on many hunting expeditions together protecting our lands from some of the more wild and dangerous beasts. I was not skilled enough to take care of a bazu mind you, but at least I could remove the threat of a few murkgliders. Jayruk, however, had no equal. I could regale you for hours of tales of how he narrowly escaped death, but I shan't waste time. Simply know that I wish to pay my respects to my good friend and for this I require the hunting vest he so loved. I will also need three dragorn ceremonial candles too. Return to me with the vest and the three candles and I will give you a plate breastplate that I was crafting for myself.");

At that moment I, a mere smith, vowed revenge for destroying what it took me a lifetime to build. I did not know how or when I would accomplish this until I crossed paths with you. You will be my instrument, exacting the revenge I cannot achieve on my own. Find the leader of this particular group of Muramites and repay it ten fold. Return to me with the medal it smugly wore -- a medal it no doubt stole from some other hapless dragorn. You also must bring me three blackened discordling tails as proof that the rest of this group has been slain as well. Do this and I will give you a pair of plate leggings that I have been working on for some time now.");

The top held a jewel of some mystery for I would always see Patorav whispering to it, but I am more interested in the bottom tip, for it you see was sheathed in a strange metal. I witnessed Patorav striking the ground with the tip only to see it penetrate any surface it encountered. The hardest stone, the most durable metal, nothing could withstand his walking stick. Thus, I have always held an interest in it as the enchantments contained therein may prove to be beneficial to my craft. Though Patorav fell during the noble's march through the causeway, his stick may yet exist. Find it and bring it back with the food and I'll reward you.");

Though most of them perished during the fighting, some were captured by the Muramites and tormented in their Proving Grounds. This was once a serene place where our elders would meditate . . . A place of peace and tranquility that my people looked toward Dranik's spirit for guidance. Now it is a place inhabited by the foulest horrors where resistant dragorns are tortured. One such dragorn was a noble warrior named Ethask. Thrown into the labyrinth unarmed, he fought off a horde of discordlings and kyvs, breaking their bodies with his bare hands. Seriously wounded, he still managed to find an exit through sheer force of will. Just as he was about to exit that black pit, a soaring [Muramite] cowardly struck him down from behind. Mortally wounded with the axe still lodged between his shoulders, Ethask crawled through the exit only to perish on the other side.");
