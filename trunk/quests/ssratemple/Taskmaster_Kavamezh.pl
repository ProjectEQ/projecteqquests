# Cursed Event - SsraTemple# This is one of the NPC's needed to be killed to trigger to Cursed Cycle. There is 10 trigger's in all, respawning every hour. When the event is not ready# One of the TM's, Rhozth_Ssrakezh (NPCID# 162258) will despawn immediately when he spawns if the global for the event is still in play. Each trigger NPC # signals it's own NoTarget NPC on death, #cursed_one through #cursed_ten. When these NoTarget NPC's receive the signal, they depop. When all 10 of the NoTarget# NPC's are despawned, the event cycle starts. In the event of a fail midway through the event, the next group of people to attempt the event will get a PH mob # with no loot, as per live. When Cursed dies, the event is no longer doable for a period of 5 days.## Written by Reno#
