Though the druids were able to quickly combine their efforts and neutralize the toxins with their magicks, grievous damage was done none the less. Two of the great protectors of the hills and the glade, Holly Windstalker and Cros Treewind, became seriously ill as did one of the glade's sacred bears.");

After getting him to comply, you are to collect a confession from Theodore and have him lead us to the two fugitives.
