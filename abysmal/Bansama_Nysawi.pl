The thing is, we've discovered some very odd stone that I would love to have time to research. They find it only in the mountains, and it has a very unpleasant feeling to it. I really want to talk to Nedaria about this. This stone seems similar to the material that the Grozmok Stone is made out of, though I can't be certain, only Nedaria could determine that. I've been calling this stone [Discord Stone] just because of the unusual properties it has. I have been able to work with it with some good results, but I'd like to have more time at it. If you could handle some of my other [duties] that might help. If you help me out enough, I can teach you the secret for preparing both Taelosian Rock and the Discordian Rock that Imildu and I came up with.");

If you work hard enough I will give you the secret for working with a Chunk of Taelosian Rock and a Chunk of Discordian Rock that Imildu and I discovered. And because I am asking you to provide the material for these tasks, I can reward you sooner than Imildu will.");
