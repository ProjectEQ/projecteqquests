I shared this gift with my fellow nihil in Riwwi and anyone else who would listen, as I share it now with you. One day the Taskmistress arrived to check on her underlings in the Coliseum. She heard my voice and slowly trotted up to me. She seemed genuinely interested in the effect my music had on the other Nihil. I remember smiling politely and singing her one of my favorite ballads, but suddenly everything went black. As far as I can tell I've been in this place ever since. What happened that day, I wonder? What became of the Taskmistress? My thoughts always return to her for some reason, as if our fates are entwined.");
