We sent brother Shen to go search the Karanas and look for Dareb over three days ago, but haven't heard from him, either. I fear the worst for both of them, especially if the [Splitpaws] are involved. Please, $name , find and return our lost brothers to us. If they are not alive, bring back their remains so we may give them a proper burial.. and, if it is that evil [Ghanex Drah]'s doing, bring me his head as well, for the honor of the clan.

His cult grew stronger and word of the evil acts spread all over Antonica. Legend has it that a group of paladins from Erudin, followers of Prexus, spent over 10 years searching out Marnek and his followers, and finally destroyed them. Though Marnek's evil reign was put to an end, many of his books and items are still being uncovered to this day.
