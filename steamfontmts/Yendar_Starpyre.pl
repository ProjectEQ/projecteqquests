Recovered any unusual artifacts lately?");

When I had time alone to study the Book of Souls, I discovered that there was a section with details on how to utilize the tainted souls. In particular, how to merge them with inanimate objects. Quite interesting light reading. Unfortunately, some of the most important pages had been torn out. I can't imagine who would do such a thing. If you ever come upon these pages, which wouldn't be unusual considering your talent for acquiring unusual artifacts, please allow me to translate them for you. I'd be most interested to find out how this story ends. Oh, and this time, watch your back and don't let any strangers follow you. My heart can't take another surprise from your admirers.");

And Laarthik, he was in the employ of someone or other, hmm. Forgive my poor memory.' His eyes widen suddenly, 'Oh! I do recall that the metal orb could be reforged over extreme heat if you were able to recover every missing piece. That by itself wouldn't be enough though, you'd need a binding element with the same aura. Furthermore, if you don't have all the pieces, melding a piece with several diamonds of bluish hue inside a forge may indicate where the remaining fragments are hidden. The orb wants to be whole again.");
