I shall task you with the creation of a few simple items from the materials available to us all. Go forth and harvest silk to make thread. Then when you feel you have learned enough, make a cap for yourself from the pelt of a bear. Return three Silk Thread and a Large Tattered Skullcap to me and I shall reward you.");

Go and protect our people hunting in the plains of Everfrost, fight against the snow orc and return to me with a Wrath Orc Wristband. Surely the spirits will forever guide you.");
