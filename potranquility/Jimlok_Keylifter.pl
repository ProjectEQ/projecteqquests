I'm sure you're thinking that's silly and all. but how many people do you know of that can say they've broken out of the Eternal Prison. let alone in? 'None', right? So, we were all ready to go in when I got word that something else needed re-appropriating all quick like. I told Gilor to wait until I got back, but no. He had to run off, eager as always and as patient as a gust of wind. Now, I think he's in [" . quest::saylink("trouble") . "].");

I'd like to check on him, but if he isn't in there, I'm liable to get myself in trouble. I think I'd be much better off staying here and waiting for him. If you want to go look for him, I'd be quite grateful. I doubt you have the skills to get far in there. You don't look like the burglarizing type, but I'd even be willing to give you the [" . quest::saylink("document") . "] that I picked up on my last job if you look for him.");

If you can't find him, be on the lookout for anything that resembles a small bottle. He's got a way with rodents; so if you see some little pest carrying a bottle of some sort, grab him! It will most likely be a message for me. Bring it back immediately. It won't be of any use to you anyway, since you can't read our code. Be quick and good luck!");

I wasn't able to track him down to get my coin, so I don't know what you'll do with it. Maybe my cousin Tabben will give you something for it. He's got himself a little tinker's shop in the Jeral section of New Tanaan. Show him the map thingy and see what he says.");
