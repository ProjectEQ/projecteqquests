Wherever he went, he discovered and experimented with all forms of dangerous magic. Most of the world cannot even fathom what the Arch Necromancer was capable of.

First, was the sharpened shoulder blade of an ancient lion matriarch. Then Thalger found a young sapling for the shaft and shaped it over the course of 45 days using nothing but his fingernails.

We figured that if we could rupture the planar boundary and create enough anti-existence or non-matter, the mantle might destroy itself.

All that was left was the spear that fell from the heavens to the ground where we recovered it. We have kept it since then and now we wish you to have it.
