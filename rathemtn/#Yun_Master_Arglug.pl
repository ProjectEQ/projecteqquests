Unfortunately, I have been unable to keep up to date on your progress, but should you need advanced training in any individual skills, I am here to help you with that. As well, I am here to help guide you through your growth as a Shaman in the Guktan Army. The spirits will also be your guide, and with the skills that you learn here, you will be better equipped to serve the Army. If you plan on following the path of a [Shaman], I have some tasks for you to complete, if it suits your interest.");

I will give you a list of items that you will need to collect, as well as a magical assembly kit in which to combine these items. Once you have successfully combined the items, it will create a material that you will use to craft a suit of armor that will protect you from the dangers of the training grounds. If you are ready to begin your task, I will give you the assembly kit and instructions for collecting the items required to craft your armor. Are you ready to receive your [assembly kit]?");

Each piece of armor will require different items to craft. These items will be available from both our outpost, as well as the training grounds near here. When you are ready to receive a recipe for a specific material, simply tell me which armor piece you [wish to craft]. I hold the recipes for Yun Initiate's [Helms], [Bracers], [Boots], [Armguards], [Legplates], [Gloves] and [Breastplates]. Keep in mind that the items required to make some of the larger pieces of armor will be a bit more difficult to get.

The bracer is one of the most basic sections of armor to craft, as well as being the easiest of all the armor pieces to collect the correct items. To create the material needed to craft your bracer, you will need to gather a crab spider's carapace, the poison sack of a bleeder, and two airborne spores, and combine them in your assembly kit. Once you have the resulting material, you will need to combine it together in a forge, along with this mold, to craft your Bracer of the Yun Initiate.");

To create the material needed to craft your boots, you will need to gather two kobold talons, an amulet from an undead froglok, and a ball of pulpy fungus, and combine them in your assembly kit.

To create the material needed to craft your legplates, you will need to gather two bull 
alligator teeth, one larval carapace, and one pristine kobold paw, and combine them in your assembly kit. Once you have the correct material, you will need to forge the items together, along with this mold, to craft your Legplates of the Yun Initiate.");

To create the material needed to craft your breastplate, you will need to gather two burly kobold ears, some moccasin poison, and two bull alligator spines, and combine them in your assembly kit. Once you have the correct material, you will need to forge the items together, along with this mold, to craft your Breastplate of the Yun Initiate.

The artifact was not extremely powerful, it had more sentimental value than anything else, but, if you could retrieve it, you would save me the trouble of having to hunt them down myself.");
