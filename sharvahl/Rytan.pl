 you to fashion xakra tooth darts. You will first need to acquire a grimling skeletal femur and place it
 in a fletching kit with the tool. This will result in three bone shafts. Place a bone shaft, a xakra tooth
 and this tool in the fletching kit to make a dart. When your fletching skill no longer increases by making
 these darts you may give me your crafting tool and I will help you to upgrade it.") ;

 crafting tool in a fletching kit and you will be able to make grimling fang darts. Keep in mind that
