After a tiring journey he finally made his way to the castle. He was never heard from again. Rumors say that the brave if not foolish knight was killed and then raised from the dead to serve Lord Mistmoore. Still others say that his bones were used to decorate the dark halls of the castle. Truth be said, no one really knows what happened to him. That is why the Paladins in Freeport need our [assistance].");
