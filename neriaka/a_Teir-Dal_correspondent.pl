We already have intelligence working against the Guktan forces to force them back into the swamps. It is intolerable that our allies be treated in such a manner. However, as you can well see, for now they are here. Their numbers have been greatly reduced and anger abounds. Having people bring back some evidence that the Broken Skull Clan suffers losses as well is good for morale, and we do pay for it; anything to keep them from exploding within our city walls.");

Bring me three of these heads in this and you shall have your reward.");
