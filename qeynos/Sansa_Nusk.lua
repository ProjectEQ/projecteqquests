Trouble is, trolls are scarce around these parts,thank the gods, but Fabian breaks his strings as fast as I find suppliers. Trolls sometimes wander the Karanas in search of food but that is so rare, to see one there. Anyhow, if you find one out in the Karanas, bring me his guts and I can make the strings to take to Fabian.");
