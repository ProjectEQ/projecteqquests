Through these eyes and ears some disturbing information has surfaced. Word is that someone is attempting to forge a weapon of unmatched prowess - a blade of assassination, potentially capable of slaying even the most powerful creatures. We know the perpetrator is an outsider. They are not a member of any of any rival thieving guild, and we cannot trust such a weapon to exist out in the open without knowing its true purpose.
