# Master Scribe Uklo
# Illusion: Guktan, good quest: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2605
# added 2009 BWstripes - because we can!
#
# Master Scribe Uklo is on an unknown Guktan faction.
# This seems to underline the fact that Sony gave up with faction except when they wanted to make it a barrier to progress, spells, items etc.
# Even though people reported the included faction hits, the frogs themselves alayws seem be indiff to all but evil, and KoS only to Trolls?
# Commented out Guktan Suppliers faction, as not entered on PEQ.
# items: 67014, 67015, 67013, 67019, 67017, 67012, 67018, 67011

The liberation of Gukta was quite a battle! Many brave Froglok warriors, a good dose of [powerful magic] and the blessings of Mithaniel Marr allowed us to cleanse this place of the vile Trolls.");
    }

    quest::say("A select few of Mithaniel's chosen know the secrets of spinning illusions. This skill allowed our bravest warriors to infiltrate the Troll's defenses and ensure victory. These are some of our most closely guarded secrets. We only [teach] them to a select few so they can better aid us in our battle.");

    quest::say("Very well, I will put your loyalty to the test. Long ago, a great hero of our people lost his life fighting the Trolls. He was in Rathe Mountains investigating a rumor that the Trolls were stockpiling special weapons in an effort to turn the tide of war back in their favor. He was ambushed by a group of troll marauders and their captain Krignok. He fought valiantly, slaying the marauders and eventually locking swords with the captain. But in the end, exhaustion got the better of him and he died by the troll's hand. The Krignok respected the froglok's ferocity and swore that they would one day finish their fight. So through a dark ritual the troll Captain locked the froglok's spirit in his own sword and broke it into 3 pieces. One piece he placed on the [battlefield] where they fought. The other piece he gave to an [infamous troll] warrior to guard. The location of the third piece has been lost over the time but there are [clues] as to where it may be.");
    }

    quest::say("The Mountains of Rathe hold many stories. One of them is the story of froglok warrior Chalex for this is the place where he was killed. Find the place where his bones are kept and say aloud 'I wish to recover what is lost' and if you are worthy you shall receive a gift.");
    }

  if($text=~/infamous troll/i){
    quest::say("Gribnor is one of the strongest trolls alive, he is also one of the shortest. His strength is the reason that the Troll Captain entrusted him with a piece of the sword because he knew that it would be almost impossible for anyone to take it away from him. Last we heard Gribnor had taken up residence in Neriak Third Gate along with the rest of those vile trolls. I warn you to be careful as allies of Gukta are not welcome in the home of Innoruuk's children.");
    }

  if($text=~/what clues/i){
    quest::say("The troll captain spent some time in the lower part of Guk. Apparently he was trying to control the undead frogs there and use them against us. His plans did not see fruition and while trying to escape he dropped the sword blade. It is rumored that another explorer found it and the power drove him insane doomed to wander the halls of Lower Guk seeking only to destroy others. I believe you will find this to be the toughest piece to retrieve.");

##Note: Quest turn in supposedly required apprehensive or better. Dark elves could get above starting dubious faction by illusion. Whether that works on the EMU is another matter
