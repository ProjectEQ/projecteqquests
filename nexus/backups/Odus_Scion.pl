Due to the limited space I share this area with the portal to Velious. The [teleport system] back to Norrath is completely automated. I have no direct control over when the portal will turn on, although I can say that the system works on a schedule of approximately ten minutes.");

When the time nears, you should stand on the elevated pad you see next to me. Shortly after you see the message that the teleporters are active, you will be transported to your destination..");
