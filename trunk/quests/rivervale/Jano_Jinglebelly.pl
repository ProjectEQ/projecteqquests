I traveled long ago when I was just a wee sprout to the city of Qeynos far to the west. It was there I grew under the tutelage of the Knights of Thunder. a noble order of paladins loyal to Karana. the Storm Lord. I have returned now to Rivervale to teach interested young halflings the ways of a Knight of the Storm Reapers so that we may defend Karana's people and lands from the [evil forces] that would see it destroyed."); }
