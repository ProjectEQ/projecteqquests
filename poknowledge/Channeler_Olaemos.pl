    quest::say("Greetings, $name. I am channeler Olaemos, one of five scholars in the art of evocation to reside here in Myrist. We have volunteered to temporarily halt our personal quests for knowledge and power beyond the material world so that we may aid the travelers in our midst. The spells we have scribed are native to your world, though in our hands they are available to all practitioners of the evocational arts despite race or religious differences. There is one other thing that I can aid you with should you truly be a wizard and that is the scribing of a most foreign and potent spell. I require you to find a piece of the untainted, fledgling magical manifestations upon the plane. These items appear as scrolls or runes that seem mundane to the eyes of mortals, though they are far more powerful than you realize. If you are fortunate enough to stumble across such a treasure, do not discard it but return it to me and I shall turn it into a power most befitting of the plane's travelers.");
