These markings are preventing me from passing into the theater and rejoining with my body so that I may pass on in peace. If you can reclaim four samples and return them to me, it may be enough to draw power from. With this power I will pass into the theater and rejoin my body and rest in peace. You do this for me, the torture of eternal capture is more than I can bear.");

They jut through the air and come down inside of the nearby theater. You hear the faint sound of bones clanking together, which is then followed by a massive moan. A sharp bolt of fear trickles up your spine as you feel anticipation fill the air.");
