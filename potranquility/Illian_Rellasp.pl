It is unfortunate that the tranquility of Quellious does not extend further into the world of Norrath. Every Deepwater Knight yearns for the eternal calm of paradise after a life of faithful service to the gods. Perhaps you have heard of one such knight that achieved transcendence. His name was [" . quest::saylink("Inte Akera") . "] and he is one of the greatest Deepwater Knights to ever live.");

While the power of tranquility is fairly well known among the holy orders of paladins in Norrath, few were able to harness the calming power of the ocean into a weapon of order. Inte was one of those holy knights. I can teach this little known magic to you, but I will need a few [" . quest::saylink("things") . "] first.");
